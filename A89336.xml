            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>I grant you that all this ſhould ſtir us up to be about this preſent duty of trying whether we be in the faith or not, and that both dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and duely, leaſt we be deceived with ſo many others, and alſo without delay, the point being of ſo great conſequence, and our life of ſo ſhort and uncertain continuance; and not to be at a point in a point of ſuch importance which betokens wonderfull ſecurity, madnes, yea ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall deadnes, tell me therefore, I pray you, ſome of the cleereſt, and ſureſt markes of faith, that I may try my ſelfe thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For your better remembering of them, you may take them up in 3. ſorts, to wit, they be either taken from theſe things which goes before faith: or from theſe things that accompany faith: or from theſe things that follow after it,

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt of all in the generall, where the Lord hath a purpoſe to worke true faith in the hearts of any, before it, he works in them that preparatorie, and ground-work of humiliation in the ſoule, and conſequently a very ſenſible change, a work indeed painfull, &amp; not joyous for the preſent, but moſt neceſſarie for thoſe who are <hi>dead in ſinnes, and treſpaſſes,</hi> as all by nature be: this he doth, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſpirit, according to his promiſe, thereby to convince them of their ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, guiltineſſe, and wants. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.8. and it is uſually called, <hi>the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 15. Now this work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, I ſay, is a very ſenſible work and makes a great and a ſenſible change in the ſoule; for it puts a ſtirring in the ſoule, &amp; an awakening in the conſcience which before was dead in ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, &amp; ſo needed ſome ſtrong allarme: it is the very pains and pangs of the new birth, which cannot chooſe but be both
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121267:12"/>painfull, and ſenſible, it is the caſting out of the ſtrong man, who, although while he holds the houſe all things be at peace, yet will not be caſt out without ſenſible unquietneſſe; ſeeing then the change is great and ſenſible, ſee and conſider, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou haſt found any ſuch change in thy ſoule or not.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But what be the particular changes that be wrought upon a man, by this work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They be many, but theſe three chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as both Scripture, and the experience of Gods own children, do teſtifie.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt great change, that is wrought upon a man in the work of humiliation, is by reaſon of the diſcovery of his guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and of his being convinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for whereas before, his mind, &amp; heart was filled with falſe preſumptions &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Gods mercy: nothing but mercy before his eyes, and no ſeeing of God in his Iuſtice; now be they quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (in this worke of humiliation) the caſe is changed, nothing ſo much before his eyes as the Iuſtice of God, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt ſin, the ſight of mercie almoſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:121267:13"/>being quite ecclipſed, he being upholden onely with a glimering (as it were) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a poſſibilitie of pardon and hanging as it were by a very hair of hope, <hi>Jona.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. nothing ſounds in his eares ſo much as juſtice and wrath: hence theſe ſayings: <hi>Lord rebuke me not in thine anger: enter not into judgement,</hi> &amp;c. His former and forgotten ſinnes are brought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance, as we ſee it fared with the ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and they are ſet in order before him; <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.21. he trembles at Gods word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. the threatnings of the word, like as the arrowes of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, trouble him and write bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as it fared with <hi>Ioh.</hi> Now all this is done for very good ends, to wit, theſe two eſpecially; firſt, for their by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt ſinnes that they may be driven to Chriſt the horne of ſalvation. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.69: that they may fly earneſtly, or at leaſt in ſincerity unto him for a refuge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. to his merits, righteouſneſſe, interceſſion, &amp;c. that being wearied and laden, they may run to him to be eaſed, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28. which otherwaies they would not do, <hi>No man can come unto me, unleſſe the Father
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:121267:13"/>draw him.</hi> Secondly, that for time to come they may ſtand in <hi>owe</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. that the feare of God may be before their eies, that they ſinne not, <hi>Exo.</hi> 20, 20. that they may be the more plyable to all duties of obedience, and that being thus meek and lowly, they may take the <hi>Yoake</hi> that Chriſt preſcribes them, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.29. and try then if ever thou haſt found ſuch a change as this, if ever thou haſt trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Gods word, if ever thou didſt apprehend the Lord in his juſtice, &amp; didſt feare his anger againſt thy ſinnes, if ever thou waſt pricked in thy heart by the threatnings of the word, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. and if all theſe have wrought ſuch a Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thy ſoul, that ſtill thou findeſt that twofold effect before ſpoken of, to wit, that for thy by-paſt ſinnes, thy heart flies for a refuge, and ſeekes to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16. that he is ſavoury unto thee, and then that ſtill thou findeſt the fear and aw of God in thy heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. that thou feareſt alwaies, and haſt a reſpect to all Gods Commandements, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.6. and judgeſt of thy ſelf accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Second great change that is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:121267:14"/>wrought in a man, by this work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, is by reaſon of his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and having diſcovered unto him his own ſinfulneſſe and corruptions, as alſo his manifold <hi>wants,</hi> &amp; great unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: for whereas before this work of humiliation, ſometimes, he had a great conceit of his freedome from ſin, at leaſt in any great meaſure the waies of a man ſeemes good in his owne eyes untill his iniquity be found to be hatefull, I thanke God I am not like this Publican. O but when this work of humiliation comes, that a mans ſinfulneſſe be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto him, he ſees afar other ſight, thinks farre otherwaies, feeles farre other things; nothing but ſin and corruption, raging in him, ſinne revives, and taking occaſion by the Commandement, works in him all manner of concupiſcence, <hi>Ro:</hi> 7.8, 9. he being now ſtirred up, the dregs of his corruptions work abundantly; ſo that inſtead of thinking that he is not like ſuch a man, he thinks that for ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſtrength, and number of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, there is none like unto him, and that he is <hi>the chief of ſinners:</hi> ſo likewiſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:121267:14"/>in regard of his wants, and graceleſneſſe and unrighteouſneſſe, there is the very like change: for wheras before, he thought well of his owne righteouſneſſe, both of the righteouſneſſe of his perſon, that he had all ſorts of inward graces, faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the love and fear of God, and that he was rich and increaſed in all things, and had need of nothing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. as alſo well of the righteouſneſſe of his actions, inſomuch, that although with the Phariſee, perhaps he did not glory in them, in his praying, hearing, faſting, &amp;c. nor perhaps, with the Papiſt, did think to merit by them; yet nevertheleſſe with the Hypocrite, he did reſt upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worke, and was ſatisfied therewith, and regarded not the manner of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>the waies of a man ſeem good in his own eyes, but the Lord ponders the heart;</hi> now he ſees a quite contrary ſight, nothing but wants, that he is poore, miſerable, naked for inward graces, <hi>Rev</hi> 3.17. and that for outward practices, all his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is as a menſtruous clout, <hi>Iſa</hi> 30. now this work of humiliation, or this part of the work, is alſo for notable good ends,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:121267:15"/>to wit, 1 to drive and chaſe a man out of himſelf, to put him out of conceit with himſelf, to make him deny himſelf, that ſo he go not about (which naturally all are prone unto) to eſtabliſh his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. And he who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains once to this work and part of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, may be aſſured that he ſhall never be Arminian, Papiſt, or Pelagian, never ſtand for free-will or merit.</p>
            <p>A ſecond end of this part of the work of humiliation is, that hereby the whole glory of mans ſalvation may be given unto the Lord, that all boaſting may be excluded, and he that glories may glory in the Lord: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Not unto us, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us (O Lord) but to thy Name be the glory:</hi> Pſal. 115.1. Not for your ſakes, be it known unto you, O houſe of Iſrael, for ye are a ſtiffe-necked and a rebellious people, but for his Names ſake.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Chriſt may be further clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and clinged unto, and that nor one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for juſtification, but alſo for ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the ſight of a mans own ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes him flie to the ſufferings and interceſſion of Chriſt; the ſight of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:121267:15"/>own unrighteouſneſſe, how all is but as a menſtruous cloth, makes him flie to, and to priſe the righteouſneſſe which is through faith: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. the ſight of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and ſpirituall diſeaſes chaſes him to the Phyſitian. <hi>The whole needs not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick:</hi> Matth. 9.12. the ſight of his wants makes him flie to the fulneſſe of Chriſts grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of that fountain and fulneſſe: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. the ſight and ſenſe of his ſpirituall weakneſſe, makes him flie to Chriſt for grace; <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> Joh. 15.5. <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> Phil. 4.13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, that the Spirit of God, the holy Ghoſt, may be the more made uſe of, and fled unto; for it is by him, that 1. our ſinfull natures muſt be renewed: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe a man be born again by the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Joh. 3.3. 2. It is by him that we muſt mortifie our corruptions, and the deeds of the fleſh. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. 3. It is by him that all grace muſt be ſhed abroad in our hearts and ſouls. <hi>Rom.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.3, 4. It is by him that we muſt be ſtrengthened in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:121267:16"/>man for all duties of obedience, yea that muſt lead us and guide us in all the wayes of God. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. And laſtly, it is the holy Spirit that muſt go out with, and powerfully accompany all the means of grace, to make them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall for all theſe ends in our ſouls: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. So we ſee the great benefit of this change, or of this part of the work of humiliation, both in regard of a mans life, and alſo in reſpect of all the Perſons of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appl.</hi> Here alſo ſee and try thy ſelf. 1. Concerning thy ſinfulneſſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: try if thou doeſt ſee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, if thou be convinced of them, and they be diſcovered unto thee; and not onely thoſe groſſer ones which a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall eye may perceive; but try if thou ſeeſt thy inward, ſpirituall, ſubtile, and moſt ſecret corruptions, as thy hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, infidelitie, ſpirituall idolatrie, a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thy heart, &amp;c. for then mayeſt thou comfort thy ſelf, that the Lord hath performed that his promiſe, in ſome meaſure, toward thee; to wit, that he hath ſent his Spirit to convince thee of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:121267:16"/>ſin: <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. and thou art in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure fitted and diſpoſed for Chriſt, being ſenſible of thy own diſeaſes: <hi>The whole needs not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick.</hi> Matth. 9.12. See whether or no thy heart can ſay humbly, and in finceritie, with the Publican, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and that with condeſcending to the particulars of thy ſins, failings, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; for if otherwiſe thou be like the Phariſee, having a conceit of thine own innocencie, <hi>I thank God I am not like this Publican;</hi> yea, like the moſt part of the preſumptuous and ſecure world, who even when they are going to leave the world, cannot be brought from ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this note of the Phariſee, they thank God they never wronged their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and for God, they ever had an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart to him; and herein they re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt, robbing Chriſt of his glory: So naturall a thing is it for men to go about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their own righteouſneſſe, and ſo hard it is to get them convinced of ſin, that afterwards they may be convinced of righteouſneſſe. And if they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves to be ſinners, becauſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:121267:17"/>they hear all others ſaying ſo, yet is it onely for the faſhion: for though they may take up ſome generals, but will they not be brought to particulars.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For thy wants, try thy ſelf alſo in regard of them, whether thou be like the Church of <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dicea,</hi> who thought it ſelf ſpiritually rich, and increaſed in all things; yea like the ſecure worldlings, who think the ſame thoughts. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, ſay they, but they have faith, but they love God, &amp;c. Or if with Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren thou truly ſeeſt thy wants to be great and many, and in the ſight of them haſt thy recourſe to Chriſt, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels us to come and buy of him raiment, fine gold, &amp;c. for thus thou haſt intereſt in that comfort, <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. See what conceit thou haſt of thy beſt duties and performances, and try thy ſelf herein alſo, whether or no with the hypocrite, thou art pleaſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (perhaps puft up with them with the Phariſee) with them, for he reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the outward work, he ponders not the heart, and therefore his wayes ſeem good in his own eyes; or otherwiſe if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:121267:17"/>with Gods children, thou truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt thy beſt ſervices to be but a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous cloth, and therefore flieſt to the pure righteouſneſſe which is by faith, for attaining of eternall life, and art ſo far from thinking to merit by them, as that thou thinkeſt it a main mercie not to be puniſhed for them; yea thinkſt that they cannot be ſo much as acceptable teſtimonies of thy thankfulneſſe in the Lords ſight, otherwiſe then as they be preſented in the name of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. and are performed with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of his interceſſion and merits. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4.</p>
            <p>In a word, ſee well to thy ſelf on both ſides, for if thou ſeeſt, and art ſenſible of thy own corruptions, wants, ſinfulneſſe of thy ſervices in the manner aforeſaid; then although the matter and things be greatly to be diſliked and grieved at, yet nevertheleſſe in this that thou ſeeſt them, and that they are diſcovered unto thee, thou haſt a ground of comfort and thankfulneſſe, for this muſt be ſomewhat more then nature; for the naturall man thinks better thoughts and conceits of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:121267:18"/>himſelf, he flattereth himſelf in his own eyes untill his iniquity be found to be hatefull: It is a token <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Or haſt thou not been, and art thou not ſenſible of thy ſpirituall wants, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinkſt thou haſt all ſpirituall graces faith, fear, love, &amp;c. or that they may be eaſily had, and didſt never finde any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie in attaining them? Or do thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and religious exerciſes pleaſe thy ſelf, and thinkſt thou that God is pleaſed with them, and that for themſelves? art thou not ſenſible of the iniquitie of thy holy things? doeſt thou not finde many challenges this way, from the manner of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:121267:18"/>thy doings, as well as when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a fin, or omits a duty, but when thou haſt poſted over the duty any way, yet thy minde is at reſt? O then deceive not thy ſelf: the eyes of thy underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are not yet opened, thou haſt not as yet gotten the eye-ſalve; go therefore, and ſeek it diligently from him who counſels thee to come and get it: Ask, ſeek, knock for the Spirit of Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to convince thee of ſin, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thou may be convinced of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and of judgement.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The third main change wrought in a man by the work of humiliation, is in regard of his taking to heart the work of his own ſalvation, and his great ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude thereabouts, being compared with his former ſecuritie: What ſhall I do to be ſaved? <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Philip. 2.12. what care, what fear, &amp;c. Whereas before, his thoughts and cares were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the things of this life; the profits, pleaſures, preferments thereof, and altogether drowned in them; no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, no ſetled thoughts about his own
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:121267:19"/>ſalvation, of all other thoughts it was leaſt in his minde: and if at any time it did enter into his heart, it was but by ſtarts or fits, being choaked with the cares and pleaſures of this life. O but now all theſe things ſeem to be but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles to him, for <hi>what profiteth it</hi> (thinks he) <hi>a man for to win the whole world, and looſe his own ſoul?</hi> the thought that takes him up moſt, that goes neereſt his heart, that is alwayes almoſt before him, is, how to get his own ſoul ſaved, even as it was with the Jaylor, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he troubled himſelf about many things, but now he betakes himſelf mainly and chiefly to the one thing that is neceſſary, ſeeks firſt the kingdom of heaven and the righteouſneſſe thereof; yea, he wonders at his former ſloth, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, ſlackneſſe, and great miſtakings about this point, and thinks he hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been in a ſtrange dream; he gets a new light and ſight, and this produceth new effects and affections in him: Before he thought it an eaſie matter to beleeve, but now he finds it (under the eſtate of humiliation) one of the hardeſt things
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:121267:19"/>in the world, and if he had the whole world, would give it to be ſure of faith unfained, he would ſell all that he hath for that pretious pearl. Before he thought it but an eaſie matter to be ſaved, that the number of theſe who were to be ſaved were many; that none but notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners were under hazard of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that at leaſt the moſt part of theſe who are in the boſome of the Church ſhould be ſaved; O but now he ſees and conſiders, that many are called and few choſen, that few there be that enter in at the gate of life, this ſtirres and ſtartles him, makes him to worke out his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with fear and trembling: <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.12. makes him give all diligence to make his calling and election ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 10. nor can he ever be quiet, or his mind be at reſt, untill he get ſome meaſure of ſatisfaction this way, about his Spirituall condition; and indeed to do otherwayes is fearfull ſecurity: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it an eaſie thing to come to the Kingdome of heaven, that ſome little time, ſome few words of prayer in the end of his life, Lord have mercy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:121267:20"/>upon me, Lord forgive me my ſins, and ſuch like, (for ſo thinke many) would ſerve his turn; O but now he thinks all his time, and all that he can do in his time, but little enough: he ſees, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that the Kingdome of heaven muſt be taken by violence, that there muſt be a ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait and right gate, that there muſt be wreſtling, running, fighting for the crown and priſe, and therefore he beſtirres himſelf to the purpoſe, he hath a <hi>reſpect to all Gods Commandments:</hi> Pſal. 119.6. <hi>keeps his precepts diligently,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>makes haste and delayes not to keep his Commandments:</hi> verſ. 60. he ſhunnes all ſin whatſoever, declines no paines, no duty: what ſhall I do to be ſaved? what will he not do to be ſaved? yea the truth is (in ſuch a caſe) the care, that a man hath of his own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath taken ſuch an impreſſion in his minde, and his thoughts are ſo carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it, that in all the meanes, and duties of Religion, (although it ſhould not be ſo) it goes nearer his heart, then the very ſervice of God; and untill his feares be rectified by faith and love, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:121267:20"/>which withholds him from ſinne, which puts him on to the uſe of all the meanes, and of all holy duties, is, chiefely and principally, fear and care of his own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Now that the Lord puts ſuch a fray, and a ſtir, and an awakening in the hearts of his own, in the beginning of their converſion, is not without good and ſpeciall reaſon, to wit, that by this means he may have them well fitted for the ſtrait and narrow way, well buckled with all the duties of obedience, well accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſts yoake, and willing to beare it, all which, unles this goade were in their ſides, this prick in their hearts, they could hardly be brought unto, want of cuſtom, and averſeneſſe of heart, being ſuch mighty impediments, beſides the tentations of Satan, and generall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our natures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appl.</hi> Try then thy ſelf by this third Mark, and part of humiliation, if ever thou haſt found ſuch a change, or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as this, didſt thou ever come to cry, What ſhal I do to be ſaved? didſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, work out thy ſalvation with fear and trembling? was taking of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121267:21"/>of heaven ſo purſued by thee, that thou waſt not quieted untill thou hadſt got ſome meaſure of ſatisfaction about thy ſpirituall condition? whereas ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thou waſt ſleeping deeply in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in regard of this great and important point. 2 Didſt thou ever take the matter to heart in ſuch a meaſure, or manner, as that the care of it made thee, and ſtill makes thee, renounce every known ſin, decline no known duty, carefully, and conſcienciouſly, frequently, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go about the means of thy ſalvation, private and publick, what ever men ſhall think of thee. 3. Did, and doth the thoughts and cares of thy own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of Gods ſervice, more poſſeſſe thee, then the thoughts and cares of this life, and of the world? whereas before, they were taken up with many things, now thou art chiefly about the one thing, which is neceſſary, and art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeking the Kingdom of heaven firſt. So that in a word, thy deſire of ſalvation is, and hath been, 1. A ſerious deſire. 2. A ſetled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and conſtant. 3. A diligent deſire, then mayeſt thou apply with comfort this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121267:21"/>Mark and point of humiliation to thy ſelf; for the deſires of the hypocrite or unregenerate, they be not of this kinde: for, 1. They be not ſerious, but weak, faint and feeble deſires, and therefore ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily born down, extinguiſhed, and choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cares or pleaſures of this preſent life. 2. They be not ſetled or conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but ſtarts, fits, and flaſhes, or like the morning dew; ſo that if they work at all, yet do they not work out their ſalvation. 3. and laſtly, they be not diligent deſires, but ſluggiſh and heartleſſe wiſhes, with <hi>Balaam,</hi> they deſire to dye the death of the righteous, they would be at the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, but have no minde to ſeek it and the righteouſneſſe thereof. But by the contrary, foundſt thou never ſuch a change, ſuch a fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Haſt thou truce with any known ſin, or declineſt thou any known
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:121267:22"/>duty? Then thou wantſt the comfort of this Mark, and haſt never been ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled; begge, therefore earneſtly, that the Lord would work this awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thee, eſpecially if thou be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the uſe of the means, that prayeſt not in ſecret, readeſt not, meditateſt not, conferreſt not, repenteſt not, &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They have, but not in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and manner, degree and kinde as Gods children have; mark therefore the difference, and ye ſhall ſee the diſtinction clear. And firſt of all to begin at the laſt point: The deſires of ſalvation that the wicked and unregenerate have (as hath been alreadie ſhewed) 1. They are not deep and ſerious deſires; hence it is, that without ſatisfaction in the point, they are eaſily ſtilled and put off with other things, with the trifles and toyes of the world, like little children, becauſe their deſires are not deep, and ſufficiently root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore is it that they are eaſily choaked by the cares and pleaſures of this world, and ſo come not to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo the things of this life go nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer their heart, and take deeper root in the ſame, then any care of the things of the life to come: So if they ſeek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven at all, yet it cannot be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121267:23"/>ſaid that they keep the rule, <hi>Seek first</hi> (or chiefly) <hi>the kingdom of heaven.</hi> 2. They be not diligent, but ſlothfull deſires, wiſhing to dye the death, but not willing to be at the pains to live the life of the righteous; either they do nothing at all for it, or at leaſt not all that they ſhould do: they may perhaps leave many ſins, as was to be ſeen in <hi>Herod,</hi> not do all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as is to be ſeen in the young man in the Goſpel, notwithſtanding he did ſeem to have a very forward and fervent deſire of ſalvation; ſtill they ſtick and ſtand at ſomething, and howſoever they ſeek the kingdom of heaven, yet adde they not this, <hi>and the righteouſneſſe thereof.</hi> 3. They be not ſtable nor conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but fits and ſtarts; unconſtant moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, like the morning dew, ſo that if they work at all, yet do they not <hi>work out their ſalvation;</hi> So that you have no reaſon to be put by the comfort of this point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of any deſires in the wicked and unregenerate this way, your deſires being 1. deep and ſerious, ſuch as could not be put off, but with ſatisfaction in ſome meaſure in the point it ſelf. 2. You ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121267:23"/>firſt the kingdom of heaven, your heart running more upon this point of your own ſalvation, and it going neerer unto your heart, then the things of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 3. You ſeeking the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and that ye have a reſpect to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, declining no duty, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining no ſin, and in thus doing ye ſhall not be aſhamed. Laſtly, thy deſires being ſtable and conſtant (although it may be not in a like degree) thou working out the work of thy ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The time was ſometimes indeed, that I could have ſaid ſo much of the deſires of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that they were ſerious, that they were not ſlothfull, that I wrought out my ſalvation with fear and trembling; but now I finde ſuch ſlackneſſe, remiſſeneſſe, ſecurity, that makes me greatly doubt that my deſires have not been ſuch as they ſhould.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is indeed an ill to be regrated, prayed, and ſtriven againſt, even this great and ordinary ill of ſecurity. But for your comfort underſtand, that one and the ſame degree of deſire and diligence, is not to be expected alwayes, no not in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121267:24"/>the beſt of Gods children, eſpecially their deſires being more ſharp, their care, their fear, their diligence more great in the beginning of their converſion, that (as ye heard before) they may be well entred in the courſe of Chriſtianitie, and well buckled with all Chriſtian duties, but many times afterwards, there will be a falling away from their firſt care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, even the wiſe Virgins will ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Chriſts own Spouſe ſleeped when her heart waked; But herein ſtands the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betwixt the inſtabilitie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie of the wickeds deſires and of the godlies. That the godly, although they remit ſometimes ſomewhat of the degree of their deſires and cares this way, yet do they never altogether return to their former ſecuritie which they had before their wakening and converſion; they may fal from their firſt care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but not from all care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; the wiſe Virgins did ſlumber, but were not dead; the Spouſe ſlept, but her heart waked, there will be ever ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wakening and ſtirring the hearts of Gods children: whereas the wicked
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121267:24"/>grow altogether as ſecure and ſluggiſh, yea more, like water heated which grows colder then before.</p>
               <p>This no doubt if you apply it to your ſelf, will give you ſome reſolution and comfort. And thus far for this point.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the ſecond point, it is alſo true that the wicked and unregenerate may have a ſight of their own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wickedneſſe, and ſinfulneſſe, but it is alſo far from the degree and kind of that ſight of ſin and corruption which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and Gods own children have, who have gotten the eye-ſalve, the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all illumination of the Spirit, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by that true light who lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man that cometh into the world: they ſee more then fleſh and blood can reveal unto them. The difference may be eſpecially ſeen in theſe foure parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The wicked and unregenerate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the light of nature, or a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall illumination they ſee ſome outward groſſe corruptions, corruptions of their fleſh, as, fornication, murther, &amp;c. yet ſee they not their inward ſecret corruptions,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121267:25"/>no leſſe reigning and raging in them, and no leſſe odious unto God, their pride, their hypocriſie, their infidelity, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, their ſpirituall idolatry, and whoring after the creature, they ſee not the filthineſſe of the ſpirit. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Although they ſee ſin in the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and fruit, yet ſee they it not in the root and fountain, they ſee not into that originall corruption of their nature, the blindneſſe, errour, and vanity of their minds, the great averſneſſe and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their wils, the inordinateneſſe and earthlineſſe of their affections, the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their conſciences, the hardneſſe, whoring, hypocriſie, and deſperate wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of their hearts; they ſee not that <hi>body of death.</hi> Rom. 7.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſee not all their ſpirituall wants, but think themſelves (as is to be ſeen in the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi>) to be rich, and to have need of nothing, to beleeve in Chriſt as well as any, to love God as well as any, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, they ſee not the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold imperfections of their beſt ſervices, but with the Phariſee, reſt upon the bare
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121267:25"/>outward performance, not pondering their own hearts, nor conſidering that the Lord ponders them; the wayes of a man ſeem good in his own eyes, but the Lord pondereth the heart: whereas, the children of God on the contrary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all their righteouſneſſe to be but a menſtruous cloth. In a word, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and unregenerate mans light and ſight of ſin, is but like an ordinary light, whether candle-light or day-light, while entring into a roome will diſcover any great or groſſe filthineſſe; whereas the light of the regenerate is like the light of the Sun-beams, which entring into a place, diſcovers the very ſmall moats in it. This is clearly to be ſeen in <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. before his regeneration, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the light of Gods Spirit by the Law, he had a good conceit of himſelf, he ſaw not concupiſcence to be ſin; but afterwards he gets afar other ſight of ſin, and of himſelf; <hi>For I was alive without the Law once: but when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I dyed.</hi> Thou then who 1. ſeeſt thy inward corruptions, thy ſecret and ſpirituall ones, as well as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

And who ſeeſt a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in thy beſt ſervices, that they are but a <hi>menſtruous cloth.</hi> Thou, I ſay, who ſeeſt and doeſt acknowledge all theſe, art not to deprive thy ſelf of the comfort of this point for any ſight of ſin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption the wicked have, for thus far thou ſhouldſt not have ſeen, unleſſe thou hadſt gotten the eye-ſalve, unleſſe thy eyes had been opened, and conſequently thy ſpirituall blindnes removed; unleſſe the Sun of righteouſneſſe had frined into thy ſoul, unleſſe thou hadſt gotten the Spirit of illumination, and hadſt been tranſlated from darkneſſe, and made one of the children of light: Thou art in a better caſe, and haſt made a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe then theſe of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:121267:27"/>thy ſpirituall povertie doeſt hunger and thirſt for that which is wanting in thee. Now bleſſed are ſuch, as our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf teſtifies; thou ſeeſt the diſeaſes of thy ſoul, and ſo art in ſome ſort fit for the Phyſitian: <hi>The whole need not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the third point, the wicked and unregenerate may be alſo, and that greatly touched with the ſenſe and ſight of their own guiltineſſe, they may be made with fear and trembling to feel the juſtice of God againſt their ſins, to have their woundings and wakenings, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and terrours of conſcience; and yet not have a right work of humiliation; But yet herein is a difference between the wicked and unregenerate, and Gods own children, and that in a three-fold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt (which is a very clear and ſure one) is this, the wicked by their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and horrours are further driven away from God, and do betake them to the wrong means of remedie, ſometimes to Satan and his inſtruments, ſometimes to other worldly delights and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thereby ſtriving to benumnie and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121267:28"/>lull aſleep their conſciences, ſtriving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to quench the work of humiliation, then rightly to entertain it, and cure it, as is clearly to be ſeen in <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Cain;</hi> the one betook himſelf to the witch in Endor; the other to the building of cities. Whereas Gods children by their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and terrours draw the nearer to God, and are ſtirred up by Gods Spirit to betake themſelves to the right means which God hath appointed, as Prayer, the Word, Gods Miniſters, and ſuch to whom he hath given the tongue of the learned, &amp;c. as is to be ſeen in <hi>Paul</hi> beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to prayer, &amp; going to <hi>Ananias;</hi> the Jaylor, and thoſe that were convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and humbled: <hi>Act.</hi> 2. they ſtrive not to quench and to ſmother this work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, but labour to entertain it, and increaſe it ſo far as is neceſſary, and then to cure it by the right remedies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the horrours and terrours of the wicked in regard of their end and iſſue drive them often to deſpair, becauſe they are not mingled with any meaſure of comfort or hope, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>Cain.</hi> Whereas Gods children in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:121267:28"/>their greateſt terrours are ſtill upholden with ſome ſecret hope of ſalvation, and conceive (at leaſt) ſome poſſibilitie of pardon, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Jonah,</hi> Chap. 2.4. <hi>I ſaid, I am cast out of thy ſight; yet I will look again towards thy holy Temple.</hi> In <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, I am cut off from before thine eyes; yet nevertheleſſe thou heardest the voice of my ſupplication.</hi> So fares it with all Gods children in their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations and terrors, there is ever ſome ſecret thing upholding them, and makes them not altogether to quit their hold.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third very clear difference is, when the work of humiliation is over, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and wicked man, if he eſcape de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and his horror weare out, he is ſo far from being bettered by it, that he grows ſenſibly worſe; he returns with the ſow to the puddle, the unclean ſpirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with ſeven worſe then himſelf; he may well fear for a time, but he fears not alwayes: Whereas the godly grows ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly better, and remains ſo after his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are over; the impreſſion and ſtamp which he had in his humiliation and ſorrow, is not like the morning dew, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:121267:29"/>being made by the ſeal of Gods Spirit it abideth, he feareth alwayes, the Lord puts his fear in his heart in ſuch a ſort that he never departs from him; before he was afflicted he went indeed aſtray, but now he keeps the Lords ſtatutes; even afterwards, and when his horrours are over, he brings forth the quiet fruits of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Application of theſe particulars are eaſie: Haſt thou ever any work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation? and did it 1. chaſe thee to God and the right means? 2. Waſt thou upholden under it by ſome ſecret hope from deſpair? 3. Now after it, art thou not worſe then before, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, undenyable better? Bleſſe the Lord for it, for thy humiliation hath been of the right ſort and ſtamp; eſpecially take comfort from this laſt clear mark, that thou ſeareſt alwayes; for the Scripture pronounces ſuch a one bleſſed; that the Lord hath put his fear in ſuch a ſort in thy heart, that thou ſhalt never depart from him, ſeeing thou feareſt him when thy horrour is over, as well as when it was upon thee, this is a token that thou
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:121267:29"/>art in Covenant with the Lord; for this is an Article of his Covenant: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. Thy humiliation mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> be a ſanctified humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, for it doth even afterwards bring forth the quiet fruits of righteouſneſſe; thou canſt ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray:</hi> But as for ſuch who have had any horrours and terrors this way, and have not betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the right means to cure them, but have rather laboured to quench them then rightly to entertain them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie them rightly, and ſince the having of them have returned to their former ſinfulneſſe and ſecurity, ſuch have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this comfort.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>This may give ſome good ſatisfaction to any about the kinde of their humiliation, but as for me, to be plain with you, I have ſuch fears about the degree of my humiliation, that it makes me greatly to doubt of the kind of it, that it hath not been deep enough, that it hath been but a flaſh, and that I am far off from that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof, that many of Gods children have had.</hi>

Some are to be put upon more eminent imployments, and therefore muſt be more throughly exerciſed and poliſhed for the ſame. 2 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, conſider that what perhaps thou haſt wanted in degree and greatneſſe, thou haſt had in continuance (the Lord wiſely and graciouſly giving out to thee at divers times that, which would have over-charged thee at one time) ſo that where the degree and meaſure of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation hath been great, there their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance hath been the ſhorter; as we ſee in <hi>Paul,</hi> who was within three daies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: the Jaylor alſo his horrour very great, but ere long he rejoyced. 3. But thirdly and laſtly, compare it never with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:121267:30"/>others, neither look to the degree of it, but ſee if it be ſufficient in it ſelf; that is, to ſee if it hath brought ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, &amp; wrought in thee, the right effects and ends, for the which the Lord works this work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in the hearts of his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for if a thing accompliſh its end it is ſufficient, and who can complain or it. See to theſe two effects eſpecially, which be the main effects and ends for the which the Lord works this work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in his own. 1. For thy by-paſt ſins, look if it made thee, and ſtill makes thee humble, and heartily to confeſſe them before the Lord, and to flie unto his mercie and Chriſts merit for forgiveneſſe, at leaſt if it makes thee do it in ſincerity, and in earneſt even to flie to thy horn of ſalvation: <hi>Luke</hi> 1.69. to thy city of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. even the mercy of God in the merits of Chriſt; See alſo if it make thee to priſe theſe alwayes in thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſometimes at leaſt with the concurrence of thy affections, above all things elſe, more then the gold, and the fine gold, ſo that they are ſavourie unto thee, like ointment poured out, ſweeter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:121267:31"/>then the honey and the honey combe, and thou in ſome meaſure art thankfull for them; if it be thus with thee, thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is ſufficient for the degree of it, for this is one of the main ends of it, why the Lord works it in the hearts of his children, to wit, that they may be drawn to Chriſt, and chaſed to him; that they may ſeek his mercie and the forgiveneſſe of ſins in ſuch a ſort as they may obtain it, that is, in earneſt, and in ſinceritie, that they may priſe, reliſh, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the rich mercie of God in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his dear Son. 2. See if for time to come thou ſtandſt in aw, and ſinneſt not: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.5. and haſt by this work of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, the fear of God put in thy heart: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. ſo that thou feareſt alwayes; See if thou haſt a tender conſcience warning thee for the prevention of ſin, and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee again after thou haſt committed any ſin, even the leaſt ſin in thought, in word, in omiſſion, in the manner of doing (which is a warning to repent.) If I ſay, it fare thus with thee, then it is a good and a ſure mark that the degree of thy humiliation is or hath bin ſufficient,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121267:31"/>for this is one of the main ends why the Lord works this work of humiliation in the hearts of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, that they may for ever afterwards fear him, and ſtand in aw to ſin againſt him, <hi>Knowing the terrour of the Lord,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. that as we uſe to ſay, like the burnt childe they may dread the fire of ſin and Gods diſpleaſure againſt it: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of Iſrael, <hi>Ex d.</hi> 20.20. when the Lord had ſpoken in ſuch a fearfull manner unto them, <hi>This</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>hath the Lord done, that his fear may be before your faces, that ye ſin not.</hi> Once awakened or a wounded conſcience, and ever a waking or a tender conſcience; and by the contrary, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and a tender conſcience is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a wakened or a wounded conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Behold what care, what fear,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. Haſt thou then theſe two main ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and ends of humiliation, trouble not thy ſelf about the degree thereof, for it is ſufficient as having attained the ends thereof.</p>
               <p>Further, the Scripture not onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a comfort, but even a ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:121267:32"/>to thoſe who flie for a refuge to the hope that is ſet before them. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18. There be alſo two other ſpeciall ends and effects of a ſufficient work of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, to wit, to produce in us true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in adverſity, and true thankfulnes for benefits and favours. You may alſo try the ſufficiencie of your humiliation by theſe; A man not truly humbled, will never be patient, will never be thankfull: But on the contrary, one who hath been truly humbled with the ſight of his own deſervings, in his greateſt adverſity he will acknowledge with <hi>Ezra,</hi> that the Lord hath puniſhed him leſſe then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And again with the Prophet, <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</hi> And as for thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, he is an admirer of the Lords goodneſſe, for he does heartily and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledge with <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he is not worthy of the leaſt of his mercies; yea that it is unſpeakable favour, that he is free from deſerved judgements: <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed.</hi> Lam. 3.22.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What you have ſpoken about the degree
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121267:32"/>of humiliation, and the kinde of it. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be good and comfortable; onely this inſtead of all I would ſay unto you: this I finde to be my caſe, I ſee, (its true) my own ſinfulnes and manifold great corruptions, as alſo my graceleſneſſe, and manifold wants, and am humbled therewith; But as for to be humbled with the ſenſe of my own guiltineſſe (though I ſee it to be very great) I muſt confeſſe that I cannot come up to this, ſo that ſetting aſide the kinde or degree of my humiliation, I fear that I have never been humbled at all.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> This is a caſe that many of Gods Children have been excerciſed with, but let us ſee what is to be ſaid to it. 1. Thou accknowledgeſt a ſight, and ſome ſence, a taking to heart thy own corruptions, well then, thou haſt ſome intereſt in that, <hi>The while need not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick,</hi> thou confeſſeſt the like of wants, ſo that thou haſt intereſt in that; <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit:</hi> thou art in ſome better caſe then thoſe of <hi>Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>a,</hi> well then, that thou art not altogether behind with it; bleſſe the Lord for what thou haſt. But to go on to the point in hand, obſerve dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that the manner, and the meanes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:121267:33"/>how the Lord works this firſt, and ground worke in the hearts of his Children, (by the experience, and obſervation of Gods Children who have bin acquainted with it) is twofold. For firſt the worke is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon the conſcience, touched with the ſence of guiltineſſe, and troubled with that eſpecially; when a mans ſinnes are ſet in order before him, and Gods wrath and juſtice againſt them, his conſcience writing bitter things againſt him. Second ly, ſometimes again the work is not ſo direct upon the conſcience, nor ſo violent upon it, but only reflects upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to wit, when a man is troubled, not ſo much with the ſence of guiltineſſe, as with the ſence of want, which alſo comes back upon the conſcience; for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſence of his manifold wants, and ſeeing himſelfe thereby in miſery, and not ſure of the remedy as he ſuppoſed, he feares exceedingly, and is put to that, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> ſo that the main thing indeed that troubles him, is the ſame with the firſt, to wit, feare of guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and puniſhment, though the thing moſt ſenſible to him, is ſence of want, for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:121267:33"/>his wants would not trouble him but for this, nor would he take them to heart but for this, to wit, becauſe finding by his wants that he is not in the eſtate of grace, as he ſuppoſed, he finds himſelf, at leaſt fears himſelf, to be under the eſtate of guiltineſſe and miſery, and this is it that troubles him. To bring the point then neerer unto you, this your caſe is a very ordinary dealing of the Lords with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his own Children, to wit, to begin the work of them, wakening and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with the ſence of want, more then with the ſence of guiltineſſe, I ſay more directly with the one then with the other: for the one (as the two) is included in the other, the reaſon of this his dealing ſeems to be this, the Lord is wiſe, and ſees what is the main ground of mens ſecurity, and ſleeping in ſin, without humiliation, and whence it ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er all that the Law can ſay to them, or threaten them with, which otherwaies ſhould be the meane of their wakening, and then the Lord wiſely fits the remedy to this mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:121267:34"/>diſcovers their wants unto them, and by them, their preſumption lets them ſee that they are not, what they thought they were, puts them out of this their ſtarting hole, and ſends them back again to the Schoole of the Law, even to the curſes of the ſame, and ſo works the work of humiliation in them. Now obſerve that although the direct and immediate work be the ſence of their wants, yet this ſence of want is not without the ſence of guiltineſſe; for otherwaies, why would the ſence of thy wants trouble thee, but onely becauſe of this? thou ſeeſt that by reaſon of thy ſins thou art guilty, and under the curſe of the Law: thou knoweſt that there is no remedy but by Chriſt, thou dideſt ſometimes think thou hadſt intereſt in him, but now by thy wants thou doſt think thy ſelfe deceived: and hence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thy trouble and humiliation. So if thou wilt marke well, the ground of all thy trouble and humiliation and that whereupon it reflects, is, from the ſight and feare, of thy own guiltineſſe, ſo that the ſence of thy want is not without the ſence of guiltineſſe, for were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:121267:34"/>that thou wert not troubled with the fear of thy guiltineſſe, the ſight of thy wants would not trouble thee, nor wouldſt thou take them to heart, as the caſe of the moſt part is, who are deeply fleeping in ſecurity; they are never affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this ſort of doctrine touching the Marks and Evidences of grace, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not whether they finde or miſſe, have or want; this indeed is a token of deep ſecuritie, of utter want of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that there is no ſenſe of guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes at all. But when thou, not onely ſeeſt, but doeſt take to heart thy wants, art greatly affected with this ſort of doctrine concerning the marks and evidences of grace, nothing fears and grieves thee more then to miſſe: nothing in the world rejoyces thee more then to finde. Here is certainly ſome freedom from ſecuritie, ſome ſight and ſenſe of guiltineſſe, and in a word, an happie wakening: at leaſt the caſe ſtands thus, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> So to thee. Now to ſuch who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſight of corruption, and wants, and their being affected in ſome meaſure therewith (which is called the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:121267:35"/>ſenſe of want) but cannot finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſenſe of guiltineſſe, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that they are truly humbled. I would ſay three things to them, laying aſide the comforts whereof I ſpake in the beginning, to wit, that in regard of the ſight and taking to heart their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have intereſt in that, <hi>The whole need not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick;</hi> In regard of their ſeeing their wants their intereſt in that, <hi>Bieſſed are the poore in ſpirit,</hi> they are in ſome better caſe, and further advanced then theſe of <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou haſt the ſenſe of thy wants, and under it of thy guiltineſſe, although thou cannot ſee it, as I have been ſhewing unto thee, ſo that (as thy being a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:121267:35"/>art in that ſame caſe of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as was the Jaylor, and thoſe that were converted at <hi>Peters</hi> preaching: <hi>Act.</hi> 2.2. Haſt thou not that tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before ſpoken of, warning thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin, checking thee after the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, of the very leaſt ſin, leaſt omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or failing in the manner of doing? Then a tender conſcience is awakened, and at ſome time, and in ſome meaſure a wounded conſcience; thou haſt one of the main ends wherefore the Lord works hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in his own, and conſequently haſt had humiliation it ſelf, thou haſt thy intereſt in that, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alwayes: Behold what fear, what care,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Tell me what it is that makes thee that thou dare not commit the moſt ſecret and ſmalleſt ſins, nor omit the moſt ſecret du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, what is it that puts thee on, and holds thee in ſuch a conſtant courſe of obedience, if it be not at leaſt the ſpirit of bondage and fear. Now the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is the very ſpirit of humiliation, when thou dare not entertain a ſinfull thought, dare not omit thy times or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atts of devotion, makeſt conſcience of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:121267:36"/>every known ſin, of every known dutie, (poſſibly more then many others who have gone far on in the courſe of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, yea, and perhaps then ſometimes thy ſelf afterwards will;) what is it that holds thee ſo waking? but even thy wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conſcience, the ſpirit of bondage at leaſt, the ſpirit of fear, the fear of God put in thy heart (a point and part of the Covenant) which is the very work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation wrought in thy ſoul. If it be any other thing that ſtirs thee up, as the love of God, it is well, thou art further advanced in grace, but at leaſt, thou can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny that the work of humiliation is wrought in thy ſoul, and therefore thank God for this, and go forward to perfection; get faith and love which caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out fear, the Spirit of adoption, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the ſpirit of bondage. Goon then to beleeve, for thou both mayſt &amp; ſhouldſt having the fear of God thus in thy heart, and being in a conſtant courſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence according to thy abilitie; that faith was never boldneſſe nor preſumption, that is joyned with fear and obedience, and that keeps to the precepts as well as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:121267:36"/>to the promiſes. It is an ordinarie policie of Satan (and we ſhould not be ignorant of his wiles, but obſerve his ſtratagems) that thoſe who have no intereſt in the Promiſes, as being void both of fear and obedience, theſe, I ſay, he puffes up with Preſumption, and makes them boldly to claim and lean to that, wherein they have no right; As long as a man makes no conſcience of his wayes, he lets him beleeve his fill (ſuch a belief as it is) when indeed he ſhould not lay hold, nor claim to the Promiſes, as is clear by that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16, 17. <hi>But unto the wicked God ſaith, What haſt thou to do to take my Covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my words behinde thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a man again hath forſaken his wicked wayes and thoughts, makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his courſes, and begins to fear the Lord, at which time he may &amp; ſhould lay hold on the Promiſes, as is clear by that remarkable and comfortable place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſſe, and hath no light? let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:121267:37"/>his God.</hi> Here is a clear warrant, and a ſweet invitation for a perſon in ſuch a caſe to beleeve and lay hold; and yet I ſay, no ſooner fares it thus with a man, but Satan and his own corruption incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently bear him back from beleeving. Obſerve this then, and reſiſt the devill, and the corruption of infidelity that is in thine own heart, &amp; bear back no longer: If bearing back and withdrawing were an allowable cauſe for thee in ſuch a courſe, thy heart would not be ſo much given unto it: we are ever to ſuſpect the way of our own heart, and to judge it wrong, that we are moſt given unto, namely, the point in hand, infidelity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſibbe to us, and which hangs ſo faſt on thee, as thou waſt given in the time of thy ſecuritie through the way of thine own heart, to preſume and lay hold, when thou ſhouldeſt not, now this way of thy own heart was clearly wrong. So now the way of thy own heart being to miſdoubt, and draw back, why ſhouldſt thou not ſuſpect it, and reſiſt it? Hold to thy comfortable warrant: thou feareſt the Lord, at leaſt thou deſireſt to fear his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:121267:37"/>Name (for even to ſuch the Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows comfort) thou obeyeſt the voice of his ſervants, or art willing to obey, ſo far as thou art able; then obey this alſo: Truſt in the Lord, and go on in a conſtant courſe of fear and obedience, and fear not to beleeve, this is the Lords ſeal, to <hi>depart from iniquity.

               <p>Finally, for thy further comfort, and for the comfort of all thoſe who are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled becauſe they are not ſatisfied in this point, about the ſenſe of their own guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe; let this be conſidered and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: as towards the promi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121267:38"/>it be not joyned with ſenſe. All this is ſpoken, not that you ought to reſt upon this degree of humiliation, for as you ought to go on from faith to faith, and from grace to grace, ſo from humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to humiliation. Moreover, the work of humiliation, namely, in regard of the ſight and ſenſe of our own guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deſervings, is the very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the work of our ſalvation and ſanctification; and therefore ſhould be well layed, greatly laboured for, and we ſhould ſtrive to have it deeply ſeated, and ſtamped in our hearts and memories. For (as any may feel by experience) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lively ſenſe of this point, goes on the livelineſſe of all other points of Religion, this point being lively unto us, to wit, the ſight and ſenſe of our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings, it makes us accordingly hearty to confeſſe our ſins, and humbly to walk with our God; it chaſes us earneſtly to lay hold on the means of our deliverie; to lay hold on the mercie of God, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Covenant, &amp;c. It makes us flie in to the very boſome of Chriſt for ſhelter, as to our City of refuge, our horn of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:121267:38"/>And laſtly, (faith being on foot, and lively withall) it is a whetſtone, and ſerves to quicken and ſet an edge upon our love, and conſequently upon our godly ſorrow, our zeal, our obedience, &amp;c. for then do we love moſt, when we are moſt ſenſible how much is forgiven us, ſo great are the conſequents of this point. So then I ſay, what I have ſpoken for your comfort in this point, is not that I would have you reſt altogether upon the degree of humiliation alreadie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by you: Onely this, I would not have it hid from your eyes what you have received, but that you ſhould ſee it, and acknowledge it, that the Lord may not want his thankfulneſſe, nor you your comfort; And that Satan may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt you by that great and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable policie of his, as he hath done with many, to bear you back from faith, and laying hold on the Promiſes, without the which there can be no comfort in a Chriſtian ſoul; yea, no cheerfull, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice to the Lord, <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him:</hi> yea the heart wants courage to do it, either to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then aſſuredly no work of humiliation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121267:40"/>hath ever been wrought in thy heart, and conſequently no work of grace: for this is the firſt work. 3. And laſtly, look how the matter is between you &amp; God, how thy ſoul carries it ſelf in regard of ſecret ſins, namely, of entertaining ſin in thy thoughts, and in regard of ſecret du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If thou dare or doeſt regard iniquity in thy heart, feed thy thoughts upon am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and covetous pleaſures or vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or ſinfull luſts, without controll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, and with delight, and dare omit or ſhuffle over thy ſecret duties; haſt thou not ſome conſtant inward principle and ſecret mover that lets thee not alone, but puts thee on to a daily and conſtant diſcharge of Chriſtian ſecret duties, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer, nightly repentance, daily and nightly meditation upon the Word of God, but doeſt all theſe duties by ſtarts, and fits, or ſuperficially, or not at all? then certainly, no right humiliation, no true grace yet in thy ſoul; be earneſt to labour for, and to pray for that which thou wanteſt, for it concerns the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſalvation of thy ſoul. Thus far for theſe Marks which be taken from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121267:40"/>of faith, or thoſe things which go before faith, at leaſt in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe three Marks of a right and true work of humiliation, or of that preparatorie work of the Spirit, which goes before faith; the way, I ſay, to make theſe Marks clear, comfortable, and convincing, is, 1. To compare them with our own former caſe and condition, and ſo to try them by experience which we have alreadie done. 2. To try them by comparing them with the caſe of the ungodly and wicked, and ſo to try them by the Word of God, which now we are to do; wherein although ſome things be coincident with things ſpoken before, the labour will not be unprofitable.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt Mark of right humiliation, and of the work of the Spirit in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is this, to wit, namely, the right ſight of ſin, the Spirit of God, when he comes firſt into the heart of a Chriſtian, working by the Law or Commandment, gives unto a man another ſight of ſin, then any natural man, how qualified ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be with humane literature and

To ſpeak more plainly and particularly of this note, when the Spirit comes and works this ſight of ſinfulnes in him, it works this threefold ſight in him. 1. A ſight of his ſin and particular corruptions. 2. Of his graceleſneſſe and wants. 3. Of his unrighteouſneſſe and imperfection of his beſt actions. Now all theſe be hid from the naturall man, as is clear by example. 1. Of the Nation of the Jews, who went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe. 2. Of the Papiſts, who take upon them for want of this ſight, to fulfill the Law, to merit, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogate. 3. Of our own ignorance, who till the point of death cannot be brought to this ſight of their own ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121267:41"/>but ever are juſtifying themſelves, thanking God they never wronged any, inſtead of confeſſing, and humbling; ſo that this is clearly the caſe of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man. But to the particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Spirit gives to a man a ſight of his ſinfulneſſe and corruptions; <hi>When the Commandment comes, ſin revives,</hi> that is, there is a further ſight of ſin: Hence is it, that, 1. they are out of conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thinking themſelves to be the <hi>chief of ſinners.</hi> 2. That they complain ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily of their own corruptions, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from the body of death?</hi> 3. They feel <hi>the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit:</hi> Gal. 5. Now the ungodly or naturall man is not ſo: for, 1. He hath not ſo evill a conceit of himſelf, as to think himſelf to be <hi>the chief of ſinners,</hi> or a great ſinner, but quite contrary: <hi>I thank God I am not like that Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi> 2. He is not ſenſible of his ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whether of the body of death, or of his actuall ſins flowing therefrom. But on the contrary, <hi>He flattereth himſelf in his own eyes, untill his iniquitie be found to be hatefull:</hi> as it is in the 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> He feels no ſuch battell between the fleſh and the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:121267:42"/>ſpirit: for why, <hi>The ſtrong man holds the houſe,</hi> ſo that all things are at peace Hence the one ſort is prepared for Chriſt, the other not: <hi>The whole needs not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick. I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But you will ſay, Hath the wicked or naturall man no ſight of his ſins?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Some ſight of ſome groſſer diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſins by the light of nature, but not ſuch a ſight of ſin as the Spirit gives to the ſpirituall man. They may ſee, 1. out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruptions of the fleſh, as theft, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, &amp;c. but not theſe more inward of the ſpirit, pride, ſpirituall idolatrie, unthankfulneſſe, infidelitie, impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. 2. They may ſee ſin in the branches and ſtreams, that is, actuall ſins; but not in the root and fountain, <hi>the body of death,</hi> the ſinfulneſſe of their nature, blindneſſe of minde, backwardneſſe of will, unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and unheavenlineſſe of affections, hardneſſe, whoring hypocriſie of their hearts. 3. In a word, they may know groſſer ſins, but not leſſer; as we may ſee by Chriſts interpretation of the Law, compared with that of the Phariſees, yea
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:121267:42"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>I knew not concupiſcence to be ſin, but by the Law:</hi> the naturall mans light or ſight of ſin, is like an ordinarie light which diſcernes groſſe palpable filthines, but will not diſcover moats; But the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall mans light is like the light of the Sun which diſcovers very moats, which an ordinarie light will not diſcover.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit gives to a man a ſight of his graceleſneſſe and wants, they ſee their faith, love, repentance, fear to be weak: <hi>I beleeve, Lord help my unbelief:</hi> I love, Lord help my love; Lord increaſe our faith. Thus they be poore in ſpirit. The wicked and naturall men are not ſo, but as it is to be ſeen in the Church of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> they think they have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſo look to the ordinarie courſe of men, O why fear I not, love I not God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit when he works he gives to a man a ſight of his unrighteouſneſſe, even of the imperfections of his beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Our righteouſneſſe is like a menſtruous cloth,</hi> ſaies the Prophet: When ye have done all that ye can do, ſay that ye are unprofitable ſervants; they know that

The ungodly not ſo, the hypocrite pleaſes himſelf with the work done, the form of godlineſſe, cares not for the manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>The wayes of a man ſeem good in his own eyes, but the Lord ponders the heart:</hi> As the Phariſee, not onely pleaſed, but puft up with good ſervice, <hi>I faſt twice in the week,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:121267:45"/>judgement is upon him, for a fit or a ſtart; but, this is not the true fear of God: for when the judgement is over, he goes to his wonted ſins. So did <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Jereboam;</hi> thus he fears not alwayes, and ſo is not bleſſed, he hath not gotten the Lords fear, as never to depart from him, and ſo is not in the Covenant. But ſee thou, if thy judgements, and afflictions, not onely whileſt they were lying on, but even afterwards, they have brought forth the quiet fruits of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>But that this Mark may be the more clear, comforting, and convincing, we will lay it out in the particulars, to wit, their fear who have the true fear, and withall let you ſee the quite contrary in the wicked, and that both from Scripture. 1. They who have this true fear, they fear Gods juſtice and anger againſt ſin, as is clear, <hi>Lord enter not into judgement with thy ſervant: Rebuke me not in thy wrath: Who knows the power of thy wrath?</hi> 2. They fear the threatnings of the Word, and tremble at it. 3. They fear his judgements againſt ſin recorded in Scripture, or obſerved by experience. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. The contrary of all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:121267:46"/>this is true in the wicked. For, 1. in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall they fear not God at all, according to a notable place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. (who if they were not ſtrangely beſotted, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might ſee that they were wrong, when even others ſee it) <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith in my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes,</hi> &amp;c. Look and conſider the place. 2. They fear not Gods juſtice and anger, they never get a ſenſible and ſerious thought of his juſtice before their eyes, but think he is all Mercie; and that therefore if they ſhould ſin all their life time, and yet but at the very laſt bid the Lord have mercie on them, that that will ſerve their turn. Whereas Gods children howſoever ſometimes they have had the like apprehenſions, ſee the Lord in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and holines, and that in ſuch a ſort, as that hardly can they get a glimpſe or glance of his Mercie. 3. They fear not the Lords threatnings, tremble not at his Word: but on the contrary, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>They are readie, when they bear the words of the curſe, to bleſſe themſelves in their own hearts, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imaginations of my own-heart,</hi> &amp;c. So
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:121267:46"/>that ye ſee there is a clear difference.</p>
               <p>Now to the Application, and that firſt for comfort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Haſt thou the fear of God, even that fear of God and not of man, that right, and conſtant fear? rejoyce. 1. Thou art in Covenant, for this is a point of the Covenant, as ye heard. 2. Thou art bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for thou feareſt alwayes. 3. Thou ſhalt not be aſhamed or diſappointed, for thou haſt reſpect to all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 4.

               <p n="2">2. For conviction.

Waſt thou never deeply apprehenſive of the Lords wrath and juſtice againſt thee? or never hadſt any ſerious and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thoughts thereof? Alas, I ſee not how ever thou haſt been driven to Chriſt; <hi>No man can come unto me, unleſſe the Father

Doeſt thou not tremble at the threatnings of his Word? then aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly thou beleeveſt them not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy belief of the Promiſes is but a phantaſſe, a falſe preſumption. 4. Doth not the Lords judgements recorded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the like ſinners with thy ſelf, affect thee? then ſurely thou knoweſt not how neer they be unto thee: thou art in a deep ſecuritie. Had <hi>David</hi> need for the fleſh to tremble? and art thou leſſe ſinfull? No: yet more ſecure.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third Mark of a true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is this: that from the ſight of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and ſenſe of guiltineſſe, or fear, there ariſes an earneſt care and ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in a man after his own ſalvation: <hi>Behold, what care, what fear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What ſhall I de to be ſaved?</hi> He <hi>works out his ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> This is indeed a great and a clear change, being compared with his former ſecuritie. But that it may be yet more clear, we will ſet down the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:121267:48"/>in this point, betwixt the godly and the ungodly; betwixt a man thus wakened, and quickned by the Lords rich mercie, and a man yet lying dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; receive it then thus. 1. The ungodly, and not wakened or quickened, they have (many of them) no cares or deſires at all about heavenly or ſpirituall things, or of their own ſalvation; their cares and deſires are about <hi>corn and oyl. Pſal.</hi> 4. about <hi>many things: Pſal.</hi> 10. give them their wiſhes and deſires, they would run this way; as for grace and glory, they think they have enough of the one, and that they are ſure enough of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The godly and wakened are not ſo, <hi>Lord give me the light of thy countenance,</hi> they take care for the <hi>one thing neceſſary;</hi> give them their wiſh and deſire, it would be grace, and not goods. 2. If they have any cares or deſires this way, they be, 1. but ſluggiſh deſires, and not diligent; they may wiſh, and would with <hi>Balaam,</hi> their ſalvation, but they do not work, much leſſe work out their own ſalvation. They may well <hi>ſeek the kingdom of heaven,</hi> but not <hi>and the righteouſneſſe thereof;</hi> this is well
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:121267:48"/>ſeen by their converſation, they uſe not the means in private, as reading, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conference, &amp;c. unleſſe it be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, poſting, pratling piece of prayer which a ſuperſtitious Pagan poſſibly durſt not omit: not unlike the Papiſts telling over their beads; and for publick duties, as little of them as poſſibly they can, with their honeſty, and were it not for regard to men, would be as little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, as they be about the private; they are ſcorners of thoſe, who take the kingdom of heaven by violence, no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence uſe they themſelves: whereas the quickned are not ſo, they not onely wiſh, but work; ſeek not onely the kingdom of heaven, but alſo the righteouſneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; they uſe means in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, take the kingdom of heaven by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. 3. Their deſires and cares are not ſetled, but unconſtant deſires; if they work, they work not out, their goodnes is like the morning dew: what they do, is by fits and ſtarts, as in the time of a croſſe or affliction, as the Iſraelites were wont to do: or by others example and inſtigation, or education, as <hi>Joaſh</hi> King
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121267:49"/>of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, or ſome ſuch outward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the godly are rightly wakened, are not ſo for their cares, deſires, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, being from an inward motive, and principle, ſome incorruptible ſeed are conſtant and ſettled, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, never to depart from me.</hi> Herein am I exerciſed alwaies, I have ſet the Lord alwaies before my face, not by fits and ſtarts, their waies are eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, they work, and work out their ſalvation, even when the affliction is over, they return not to ſin with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> but afterwards bring forth the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et fruits of righteouſneſſe, not by others inſtruction, but with <hi>Joſhua, If all ſhould forſake the Lord, yet I and my h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But you may ſay, how ſhall I know this? 1. Becauſe if they were ſerious they would not be put off without ſatisfaction in the point, for ſuch are the deſires of the godly: whereas the deſires and cares of the ungodly are not ſo, but are choaked with the thornie cares or pleaſures of this
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:121267:49"/>preſent life; even like a child if it be but ſome little ſmall deſire that troubles it, it is eaſily put off and ſtilled, but if it be a ſerious deſire, a pinching neceſſity it will not be ſo ſoon quieted; Hence ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>As new-born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the Word,</hi> the deſires of the godly, be like the deſires of a child new born, or in neceſſity not to be ſtilled without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the point; whereas the deſires of the ungodly, be like the deſires of a child, who not being under ſuch pinching neceſſity, is quieted with ſome one toy, or other, choaked with ſome worldly pleaſure. 2. If they be ſerious cares, or deſires, they will make one to do any thing for attaining of ſalvation, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all ſort of ſin, to decline no ſort of known duty; <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved? what ſhall I do,</hi> ſaies the Jalor; <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to doe,</hi> ſaies Paul; what ſhall they do what will they not do to be ſaved, no ſin wil they entertain nor allow, ſome ſin may well give them their handfull, may lead them captive to the Law of ſin, may hang on them, Iniquity may prevaile
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:121267:50"/>againſt them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. but they allow no ſin; the evil they would not, that they do, they regard no iniquity. So alſo they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline no known duty, no certainly known duty; this is a ſure Mark, <hi>Then ſhall I not he aſhamed, when I have reſpect to all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> Whereas the ungodly may, with <hi>Herod,</hi> leave many ſins, but ſome there be they will not leave; they may well pretend they will decline no duty, with the young man, and ſay, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit eternall life?</hi> yet with him, when it comes to the point, they ſtick on ſomething, and in ſome dutie. 3. If the deſire and care of their ſalvation be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it will be that which takes up the chief roome in the thoughts, heart, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a man or a woman, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one is chiefly taken up with all the day long, to wit, with cares to pleaſe, and fears for diſpleaſing; and that partly (and indeed mainly ſhould be) in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, partly in a relation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make their calling and election ſure by well doing: this is the chief of their care all the day long; this is the ground of their contentment, or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:121267:50"/>at night; Herein am I exerciſed alwayes to keep faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: I ſet the Lord alwayes before me. So as they ſeek firſt the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 2. and the righteouſnes therof. With the ungodly and naturall men it is not ſo, their cares are otherwayes taken up all the day, the Lord is not before them; their contentment and diſcontentment ariſes from other grounds at night; either they ſeek not the kingdom of heaven at all, or not it, with the righteouſnes ther of, or not it firſt with the righteouſneſſe therof; there goes ever ſomething nearer their heart, &amp; it fares with them as with the young man in the Goſpel, though he ſeemed to have great care for, and deſire after it, even after ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The Application follows, and firſt for comfort. See firſt whereupon thy cares, and deſires, and endeavours do run, and with what they are taken up, whether or no upon the ſalvation of thy own ſoul, and the ſerving of God, the two main ends for which we are come into the world; or upon other inferiour tranſitory trifles, whether upon the many things,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:121267:51"/>or the one thing that is neceſſary; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſeekeſt the kingdom of heaven, or other things; whether or no thou haſt embraced this preſent world, or in effect uſes it as though thou uſedſt it not, as knowing that the faſhion thereof periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; uſeſt thou this world as if thou uſedſt it not; car'ſts not greatly for it? It is well, it is like thou doeſt beleeve that there is another, even a more dureable ſubſtance. Haſt thou choſen the better part, and art ſtill ſeeking; fear not, it ſhall not be taken from thee. 2. Be thy cares and deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this kingdom not ſluggiſh, but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent deſires, ſo that thou not onely wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, but workeſt thy ſalvation; thou not onely ſeekeſt the kingdom of heaven, but alſo the righteouſneſſe thereof, and doeſt take the kingdom of heaven by violence; giveſt all diligence to make thy calling and election ſure, uſeſt the means in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and in publick, &amp;c. Then be of good comfort, thou keepeſt the precept, and ſo ſhalt not miſſe the promiſe, which is, <hi>The vio 'ent take it by force;</hi> thou uſeſt the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended mean, and ſo ſhall not miſſe the end. If ye do ſo, <hi>Entrance ſhall be miniſtred
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:121267:51"/>to you abundantly into the kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 3. Are thy cares and deſires ſtable or conſtant, not for a fit or a ſtart, but thou workeſt, and workeſt out, and that not onely in the time of affliction, but even when it is over thou bringeſt forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe; thou haſt ground of comfort, for this is ſurely a ſanctified affliction, and conſequently thou art not a baſtard, but a ſon: yea even although it be not poſſible in the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as in the very time of thy affliction; yet ſeeing thou art more fruitfull then before, it is well: for the wicked return to their former, yea oftentimes, greater ſloth and coldneſſe, his laſt eſtate is worſe then his firſt. Doth thy conſcience bear thee witneſſe, that although all others would break the Lords commands, yet thou with <hi>Joſhua</hi> wilt ſerve him? Then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly thy obedience flows from ſome inward principle not ſubject to change; and not from any outward reſpect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, education, &amp;c. Laſtly, is thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and care a ſerious deſire, was there ever ſuch a wakening a fray upon thee, that indeed it made thee to work out thy
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:121267:52"/>ſalvation with fear and trembling, take the kingdom of heaven by violence, waſt thou indeed at that, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> what ſhall we do? what wilt thou have me to do Lord? &amp;c. Here then is the ground of comfort, for this you ſee is the way of the Lords working with his own children; this agrees with the Scripture both in the precepts and examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Now all Scripture is written for our edification and comfort, eſpecially if thy care, 1. was not ſtinted without ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the point, was not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes put off, or choaked with the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie cares, but like the deſire of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born babe, as ye heard before. And, 2. if this care and fray hath made thee to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue all ſin, to decline no dutie; O then thou ſhalt not be aſhamed, for thou haſt reſpect to all his Commandments. And 3. Doth this care of thy ſalvation, and pleaſing of God take up the chief roome of thy thoughts, heart, affections, ſo that upon this runs thy care all the day long; and from hence ariſes thy ſpeciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment or diſcontentment at night, this again is like Gods children and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:121267:52"/>modell of Scripture. <hi>Herein am I exerciſed alwayes to keep a good conſcience,</hi> ſaies the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; it was his exerciſe all the day long: thou haſt ſet the Lord always before thee, and therefore thou ſhalt not be moved; this is indeed not onely to ſeek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, and, 2. the righteouſneſſe thereof, but even to fulfill the precept, to wit, Seek firſt and above all the kingdom of heaven and the righteouſneſſe thereof, this is not onely to work, and to work out our ſalvation, but even to work it out with fear and trembling, that is, with great diligence and care, and ſo to fulfill this precept alſo. Thus far for comfort. Now for conviction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 1. But as for the man that is all for this preſent world, that as yet took never to heart the ſalvation of his own ſoul, and hath no care or ſolicitude this way, but while the Scripture is bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him work it out with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, he, I ſay, never knew what it was to give obedience to this exhortation, and ſo cannot be right, eſpecially the Scripture telling him what reaſon he hath to do it, and to take to heart the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:121267:53"/>matter, telling clearly, that <hi>many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but few are choſen;</hi> how that <hi>ſtrait is the way that leads to life, and few there be that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein:</hi> and therefore we are bidden, <hi>ſtrive to enter;</hi> how that many ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; <hi>Not every one, that ſaies Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven;</hi> how that many ſhall ſay, <hi>We have preached, caſt out devils in thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. and yet be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, ſo that we had need to ſee to our ſelves. If for all this, I ſay, thou haſt had few thoughts, and thoſe not earneſt ones of ſo main, ſo neer, ſo concerning, ſo important a point, thou art clearly ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſecuritie, and not yet awakened, not quickened from being dead in ſins and treſpaſſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be thy cares and deſires ſluggiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the publick means thou uſeſt them for reſpect to men; but as for the private means, where is thy reading of Gods Word, meditating on it day and night, laying it up in the midſt of thy heart, thy holy conference, thy nightly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? &amp;c. thy prayer being but a mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>pater noſter:</hi> if thou do no more, alas, thou uſeſt not the means, and ſo canſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121267:53"/>not attain to the end, thou workeſt not thy ſalvation, thou ſeekeſt not the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven with the righteouſneſſe thereof; thou takeſt it not by violence. In a word, thou walkeſt not in the ſtrait way, but in thy own eaſie, lazie, ſluggiſh way; and ſo aſſuredly art not in the way that leads to life and ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be thy deſires, and cares, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours not ſetled but unconſtant, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe thou haſt done ſomething this way about the righteouſnes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, about the working of thy ſalvation; yet hath it been but by ſtarts, and fits, upon ſome ſolemn occaſion, as, Communion, Faſt, &amp;c. or when Gods hand was upon thee, the wicked will do that; Thy goodneſſe is like the morning dew; thou workeſt, but workſts not out: what thou doeſt is but from an outward principle; the Lord hath not given thee his true fear, to wit, to fear alwayes; to fear ſo as never to depart from him: And even afterwards to bring forth the quiet fruits of righteouſneſſe. In a word, thou keepeſt not the rule, and ſo art not right; thou ſhouldeſt ſerve him in righteouſnes
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:121267:54"/>and holineſſe, not for a day, or a time, but all the dayes of thy life; take heed to this ye that are ſo eaſily broken off from a good courſe, and from good duties.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, be not thy cares and deſires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. 1. Waſt thou never at that fear, that care, that wakening, never at that, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> didſt never work out thy ſalvation with fear and trembling? Couldſt thou never ſay, thou haſt uſed violence to the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Surely to ſay no more, thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thoſe of, and to whom the Scripture ſpeaks, both in regard of precept and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; I grant all are not dealt with alike, or after the ſame degree or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but, I ſay, if thou haſt not found it in ſome meaſure and degree. 2. Or if ever thou hadſt any ſuch wakening, ſee how got, it was ſtilled and pacified; gotteſt thou no ſatisfaction in the point, waſt thou never the nearer to thy ſalvation, and yet art ſtilled and quieted? Sure this was no ſerious deſire, or care, but hath been ſtilled by the thornie cares or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, or elſe hath dyed out
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:121267:54"/>of its own accord, and ſo hath not been of the Spirits kindling. 3. Did not, and doth not this care and wakening make thee renounce every known ſin, &amp; cleave to every known duty, but ſtill thou har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureſt ſome ſin, and wilt not ſubmit thy neck to the yoke of ſome duty or other: O then thy deſire, thy care, thy waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thy wound hath not been ſerious, hath not been deep enough to bruiſe out all corruption; thou ſhalt be aſhamed, and diſappointed of the Religion thou haſt, becauſe thou haſt not reſpect unto all Gods Commandments. He that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends in one, is guilty of all; thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt iniquitie in thy heart, the Lord will not hear thy prayer; thou art but counterfeit coyn, for thou wanteſt the Lords ſtamp and ſeal, to wit, <hi>to depart from iniquitie,</hi> even every iniquitie; thou giveſt not all diligence to make thy calling and Election ſure by well doing, even every ſort of well doing: <hi>Adde to thy faith, vertue,</hi> &amp;c. which thou wouldſt do were thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and care but ſerious.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, be thy thoughts, heart, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, otherwayes taken up all the day
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:121267:55"/>long, and run more upon other things, then upon the plealing of God, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thy own calling and Election ſure, the keeping of a good conſcience? And doth thy contentment, or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, thy grief and joy, peace or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe ariſe from other grounds at night? Then be ſure, ſome other thing goes nearer thy heart then God, or Chriſt, or thy own ſoul; thy care is not ſerious, thou fulfilleſt not the rule, thou ſeekeſt not firſt the kingdom of heaven, thou art not herein exerciſed alwayes to keep a good conſcience; thou doeſt not ſet the Lord alwayes before thee, and ſo canſt not conclude, that he is at thy right hand, and ſo ſhalt not be moved.</p>

               <head>MEANS OF HUMILIATION.</head>
               <p>VVE have already ſpoken of the generall directions concerning the working of Gods Spirit in the hearts
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:121267:55"/>of his children, how we ought to carry our ſelves upon the diſcovery of the want, or weakneſſe of any grace or work of Gods Spirit in our ſouls, to wit, not to give place to deſpair; but firſt of all, by earneſt and frequent prayer to have our recourſe to God, who gives liberally to all, and upbraids none, and who hath promiſed not to deny his holy Spirit to them that ask it. Now although this be a good and main way to obtain what we want, yet we muſt not reſt here, but, to prayer, muſt joyn the uſe of the means, or elſe we ſhall not ſpeed, pray we never ſo diligently. The Lord will have us put to our hand, and therefore commands us work out, &amp;c. And to this we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded even to humble our ſelves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be the work of Gods Spirit: I tell you that a point very much to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heed to, was, that in uſing the means, it is not enough to uſe the means in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, the Word and the Sacraments, but we ſhould conſider the particular means, the fitteſt and neareſt means to beget or ſtrengthen ſuch a grace; and for want of this, we may take very great
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:121267:56"/>pains in generall, and we ſhall hardly ſpeed: and therefore we ſhould ſee how far the work is proceeded in, &amp;c. And as what our wants be, and where the ſtop lyes, and then to pray, and to uſe means moſt diligently, and to uſe the particular and neereſt means: and therefore I thought it moſt needfull to lay out the neareſt and moſt particular means of this work of humiliation, that ſo we uſing them, the Lord bleſſing and concurring by his Spirit, thoſe who have not found this humiliation at all as yet, may have it wrought in them; and ſuch of us who have found it in ſome meaſure, may get it increaſed and ſtrengthened; and ſo all of us may be taught how to give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto this exhortation, <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. The firſt, and indeed a main mean to work humiliation in us, is, ſeriouſly to miditat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> upon the law, &amp; the threatnings thereof, and to apply them to our ſelves in particular, conſidering withall the truth of him that hath pronounced them. This by the concurrence of Gods Spirit, will be a notable meane, both to bring
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:121267:56"/>us to a right ſight of our ſinnes, and to humiliation for them; for, as the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of ſinne,</hi> it is the glaſſe and mirrour that only can let us ſee the foule ſpots of our ſouls. And again to conſider the threatnings will bring us to humiliation, <hi>While I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, I lived, but when the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement came, ſin revived, and I dyed:</hi> would you then take a courſe to get this worke of humiliation wrought? Firſt of all get the cleere knowledge of Gods Law, and examine thy ſelf by it, lay the rule of the Law to thy own heart, and ſo ſee how great a tranſgreſſour thou art: for want of this, the moſt part of men and women live in ſin, without knowing that they ſin, and ſo without either repentance or amendment, which is both pitifull, and dangerous pitifull, in regard of the Lords holy will: dangerous to your own ſouls: all will ſay, they are great ſinners, but I fear they ſee not wherein, and ſo can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repent, nor amend. O but if thou wouldeſt apply the law to thy ſelf, thou wouldeſt ſee that thou haſt bin, and ſtill art, an exceeding great tranſgreſſour.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:121267:57"/>Conſider the firſt Command, and ſee if thou doſt not ſin exceedingly againſt it, if thy heart does not whore and commit ſpirituall adultery with the creature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting and truſting more in it, then in the Creator, God bleſſed for ever? and thou ſhalt find alſo, that thou putteſt thy ſelf moſt frequently in Gods place, making thy ſelf the utmoſt end of all thy actions, which how horrible ſins they be, I leave to thy ſelf to judge: Was not this laſt <hi>Herods</hi> fault, whom the Lord deſtroyed? Conſider the ſecond Command, and thou ſhalt ſee there be many points of Gods worſhip that thou, I fear, doſt altogether neglect; as that of meditation and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and that all of them, are for the moſt part ſuperficially, and ſlightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by thee, and that thou comeſt within the compaſſe of that curſe, <hi>Wo be unto them, that do the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</hi> Conſider the third Command, and not to ſpeake of thy frequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of Gods name, ſee what either thou haſt done, or ſpoken, to the honour of Gods name, notwithſtanding it is the many things that thou waſt made for;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:121267:57"/>Look to the 4th. Command, and ſee how thou haſt ſanctified the Sabbath in thy thoughts, and diſcourſes, yea ſee if thou haſt not done in this point againſt thy light, and even refuſed to return, and haſt hated to be reformed; choſen rather to diſpleaſe the immortall God, then mortall men; choſen rather to follow thy own will, then the will of God: and that notwithſtanding he hath recommended it as a ſpecial point of his will unto thee, and hath bidden thee remember to keep it holy.</p>
               <p>Conſider the fifth Command ye that are ſuperiors, whether ye render to thoſe that are under you that which is juſt and equall. And ye that are inferiors, if ye give your ſuperiors that honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in your hearts that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: and if ye pray unto God for them. Look to the ſixth Commandment, and ſee whether or no thine heart doth not often riſe in anger againſt thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, without, or for a very ſmall cauſe; and thy mouth doth not break out into miſcalling of him, yea perhaps in curſing him, which is the very height of murther.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:121267:58"/>And remember what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that is angry with his brother without a cauſe is in danger of the judgement: Or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſay to his brother, thou fool,</hi> (or any thing as ill as this) <hi>is in danger of hell fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider alſo the ſeventh Command, and remember how it alſo is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thy heart, and to thy ſpeeches; and ſo meets with all thy unclean thoughts, and unclean ſpeeches. And look how thou haſt carried, and doeſt carry thy ſelf in the other points of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, in thy drinking, in thy eating; a point certainly that many fail in, and few conſider; yea, and in thy wearing. Conſider the eight Command, and ſee if perhaps thou haſt not wronged thy neighbour in his goods; but how haſt thou imployed thy own? how wilt thou clear thy accounts to him who will take account of the talents he hath committed to thee? haſt thou not ſpent much ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſly, and unneceſſarily, when the members of Jeſus Chriſt have been like to ſtarve for want?</p>
               <p>Look to the ninth Command, which forbids thee to ſpeak to the diſgrace of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:121267:58"/>thy neighbours name, whether it be true or falſe that thou ſpeakeſt; for love ſhould cover imperfections, and we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do as we would be done to. And ſee the propenſion of thy heart to break this Commandment, nothing ſo incident to us, as in our diſcourſes to fall upon our neighbours imperfections, and to talk of them with delight: a ſigne we want that love which is the ſumme of all. As for the tenth Command, thoſe that ſee any thing, cannot but ſee that body of death.</p>
               <p>I have gone briefly through the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, touching onely theſe things that I think people are moſt guilty of, ſo to lead you to the knowledge of ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there can be no humiliation, no repentance, no amendment; I beſeech you take heed to the particulars, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to your ſelves, and pray the Lord more and more to give you the eye-ſalve, and to open your eyes, that ye may ſee the wonderfull things of the Law, that ye may ſee what is diſpleaſing to him, and dangerous to your own ſouls.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, having thus applyed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:121267:59"/>the Law to your ſelves for the knowledge and diſcovery of ſin: Then in the ſecond place apply the threatnings and curſes of the Law to your ſelf for your humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to this end conſider the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and greatneſſe of them, the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and extent of them; they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly exceeding great and fearfull; they extend to the body, to the minde, to the temporal and ſpiritual care of a man, to this life, and to the life to come; and they are very fearfull in all theſe reſpects. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider chiefly the univerſalitie of theſe threatnings in regard of their object, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, great and ſmall, young and old, he or ſhe, are lyable to the curſes of the Law; we ſhould conſider this, for we are exceeding prone to make an exception, and to bleſſe our ſelves in our hearts when God curſes, and to ſlip the choller. But what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Curſed is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that abideth not in all things,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>tribulation and anguiſh is on every ſoul that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th evill,</hi> &amp;c. We ſhould alſo conſider the truth of him that hath pronounced theſe threatnings, even God, that cannot lye: <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but not one

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of his Word ſhall paſſe away.</hi> Now all this is little enough to move us, for we are wonderfully given to this, to ſhift the threatnings of the Law off from our ſelves, although we cannot deny that the Lord is true that hath pronounced them, yet indirectly our unbeleeving ſhifting hearts do it, like thoſe of whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, Chap. 5.12. <hi>They have bolyed the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſaid this evill ſhall not come upon us.</hi> What elſe do they, that walk in their ſins, and yet think that the threatnings of the Law ſhall not over-take them, but even give the Lord the lye?</p>
               <p>And again, although the threatnings and curſes of the Law be ſo generall, and univerfall, as ye may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. the Lord fore-ſets that there ſhall be ſome (and, alas, would to God that the moſt part were not ſo) who, when they hear the curſes of the Law, ſhall nevertheleſſe bleſſe themſelves in their own hearts, and ſhall ſay, <hi>I ſhall have peace though I walk in the imaginations of my own heart;</hi> how many are there of this kind, that ban, &amp; ſwear, and drink, and rail, and break the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:121267:60"/>ſecurely, and yet nevertheleſſe bleſſe themſelves in their own hearts, &amp; think that no ſuch thing ſhall overtake them, all ſecure ſinners are of this ſort. O but what ſaies the Lord to ſuch a ſoul? <hi>The Lord will not ſpare him, but the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt him; and all the curſes of his book, ſhall come upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name under heaven.</hi> O that ſecure finners would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this! But what ſhall I ſay of the ſlowneſſe of men and women to beleeve the Lords threatnings, the curſes of the Law, they are ſo ſenſleſſe and ſtupid, that when they ſee them executed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea when they feel them upon themſelves, diſeaſes upon their bodies, grief upon their minds, &amp;c. yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, they conſider not that it is by vertue of the Lords threatnings, that this comes upon them, ſo to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the mighty hand of God. This the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 5. ſets down to have been the ſenſleſſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people of his time; <hi>Thou hast ſtricken them, but they have not grieved; thou haſt confumed them, but they have not received
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:121267:60"/>correction.</hi> And he concludes, <hi>Surely they are poore, they are fooliſh, they know not the wayes of the Lord, nor the judgement of their God.</hi> This is a lamentable caſe, and yet a common caſe, we ſhould pray the Lord to ſave us from this ſenſleſneſſe. They are happy, that when adverſitie comes upon them, get grace from God to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be for their ſins, and ſo humble themſelves, and are not condemned with the wicked world; for ſo they prevent the wrath which is to come. But happie were we, if we would beleeve Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings without feeling of them, for then we ſhould prevent afflictions alſo; would we judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now there be two things eſpecially that ſtand in the way, and hinder the threatnings of Gods Law from having their due operation upon the hearts of men and women, and makes men and women to be ſecure, notwithſtanding of the peremptory threatnings of the Law. And I beſeech you take heed unto them, that ye be not alſo lulled aſleep by them, in ſuch a ſort that the trumpet of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:121267:61"/>Law, and thundrings cannot awaken you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, that people do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider duly of the patience and long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the Lord, and therefore they come to miſtake and miſdoubt his juſtice and the truth of his threatnings, they ſee no ſuch thing, they have been living in their ſins ſo long, and never found that things went otherwiſe then well with them, no dint of any ſuch threatnings; yea they ſee others ſo alſo, none living more pleaſantly, nor more proſperouſly, then thoſe who take very great liberty to themſelves to break the Law of God; and this certainly hardens the heart of many a ſinner, as the Scripture bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: <hi>Becauſe ſentence is not executed against the wicked ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the children of men are fully ſet in them to do evill;</hi> becauſe men are not preſently puniſhed, and taken out of hand, as we ſay, but get leave to go away, and eſcape with their ſins for a time; therefore both themſelves and others take the greater liberty to ſin: and ſurely we have need to take heed to this, for we have all a tang of it, were
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:121267:61"/>ſin but inſtantly puniſhed, we would ſtand more in aw to offend then we do. But this the Apoſtle meets with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well and peremptorily, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. at the beginning: firſt he layes down a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie concluſion againſt ſuch perſons, <hi>Thinkest thou this, O man, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgement of God?</hi> No, think thou what thou wilt, ſaies he, we are ſure that the judgement of God is according to truth againſt them who commit ſuch things.</p>
               <p>O but, ſaies the other, I feel, I fear no ſuch thing, I have lived long, but have not found it ſo, and others have lived out their life, and dyed peaceably, and have had no bands in their death?</p>
               <p>To this he replyes two things: the one is, the reaſon that thou art not dealt with according to Gods juſtice, and judgment, and threatnings, is not from thy deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but from the riches and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, long ſuffering, and patience of the Lord, waiting upon thy repentance: which if thou deſpiſe, when the date of it is run out, thou ſhalt find the truth of his threatnings, and the debt of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſo much the greater. The other thing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:121267:62"/>he replyes, is this; although thou ſhouldſt eſcape the Lords juſtice and judgement all thy life time here, what of that; is there no other place for juſtice, for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the accompliſhment of Gods threatnings, then in this life? is not the chief in the life to come? Alas, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt not (fare it with thee here as it will) that yet thou art treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the juſt judgement of God.</p>
               <p>O that you would conſider this now, that ye are not a haires breadth further off, or at leaſt the freer from the curſes of the Law, that they are not inſtantly powred out upon thee, what of that, yet ſurely as the Lord is true, they do abide thee: and when the Lord hath given a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofe of his patience towards thee, they ſhall come upon thee, when thou leaſt expecteſt, as pains on a woman in travell, if not in this life, yet in the life to come; and therfore be not the ſecurer for this, that they are not yet come upon thee, but if thou wilt prevent this, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf, under the mighty hand of God. The other main impediment hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:121267:62"/>the Law, with the threatnings of it, to have the due operations of it, upon the hearts of people, as any may ſee, is, their preſumption, both in miſapplying the Lords mercy, and Chriſts merits to themſelves, when as indeed they have no intereſt in them, and yet this is it, that makes them ſecure againſt all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and alſo miſtaking the manner of obtaining mercy. Firſt then I ſay they preſume and miſapply Gods mercy, and Chriſts merits to themſelves, this is the thing that makes many a ſoule to periſh, and therefore I beſeech you take heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, they acknowledge that they are ſinners, and that the curſes of the Law does belong to them. O but they believe in the mercy of God, and in the merits of Chriſt, in him who hath freed them from the curſe of the Law, and ſo they leap o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the threatnings of the Law; O but deceive not thy ſelf, this is the way, that many periſh in; ſee that thy relying upon Chriſt, and the mercy of God, be upon good grounds, &amp; ſure warrants, do all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that ſay or think they beleive? come to any almoſt, will they not ſay, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:121267:63"/>as well as others? but the Scripture ſaies, that <hi>Many are called, and but few are choſen:</hi> it ſaies, that <hi>many are deceived;</hi> and why mayeſt not thou be deceived among the reſt? Indeed if thou haſt ever been humbled for thy by-paſt ſins, and ſo haſt fled unto Chriſt, and ſtriven to reſt upon him; If thou haſt broken off the courſe of thy iniquity, and turned thy back upon thy ſins, and art endeavouring to repent of what is paſt, and to abſtain for time to come: if the Spirit of God hath made any work in thy ſoul, then thou mayeſt be bold.</p>
               <p>O but if none of theſe be, no work of the Spirit in thee whereof I was ſpeaking, haſt thou not broken off the courſe of thy iniquities, but ſtill walkeſt according to the imagination of thy own heart, and yet doeſt bleſſe thy ſelf, notwithſtanding the curſes of the Law? Be thou ſure, it ſhall be true which the Lord ſaies, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. all theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee. Walkeſt thou in darkneſſe, that is to ſay, after the dictates of thy own corrupt heart, and the courſes of the wicked world? doeſt thou, as thou ſeeſt others
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:121267:63"/>do, and as thy own heart gives thee leave, and takeſt no heed to order thy wayes according to the lantern of Gods Word; for this is to walk in darkneſſe? then beguil not thy ſelf, this ſhift will not ſerve the turn, it will not free thee from the curſe of the Law; Chriſt, it's true is able to do it, but thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with him as yet; What ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>He that ſaith he hath fellowſhip with him, and walks in darkneſſe, he is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> For theſe again who deceive themſelves by miſtaking the manner of obtaining mercie, they think, that when they have ſinned all their life time, that a God have mercie upon them ſhall ſerve their turn, and then think that they may beleeve, repent, and get mercy when they will, and for a word: O but let me tell ſuch, theſe things are not ſo eaſily gotten; and none ſo far from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mercy, as they that preſume upon it: yea, did not many of Gods children find it hard enough all their whole life to get faith, repentance, and mercy, and wilt thou come ſo eaſily by them, and thinkſt to get mercie for a word of thy mouth?</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:121267:64"/>
               <p>And finally to end this point (for thy ſelf) ſuppoſe that thou wert ſure of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and that thou hadſt already obtained mercy; yet thou haſt need nevertheleſſe to humble thy ſelf under the mightie hand of God, therby to prevent the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Lords chaſtiſements, and to be corrected in meaſure; thou haſt need to judge thy ſelf, that thou mayeſt not be judged; for even where the Lord is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, he takes vengeance for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he may well correct in meaſure, but he will not leave altogether unpuniſhed. Upon <hi>David's</hi> firſt confeſſion it was ſaid to <hi>David, Thy ſins are forgiven thee:</hi> and yet ye ſee what he ſuffered both in regard of ſpirituall and temporall croſſes; as the 51. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the Hiſtory can bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>This ſhould ſtartle all ſinners, and make them to haſte out of their ſins: ſuppoſe thou get mercie and repentance, which is but a peradventure, yet nevertheleſſe thou ſhalt find that is an evill, and bitter thing to depart from the living God; the Lord will have thee to find ſome dint of his threatnings both upon thy temporall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:121267:64"/>and ſpirituall eſtate. Look what ever pleaſure thou tookeſt in ſinning, the Lord will have thee one way or other to taſte as much bitterneſſe by his chaſtiſements: and therefore that theſe may be in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we have need to humble our ſelves under the mighty hand of God, and to walk humbly with our God all the daies of our life.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point then, which I have inſiſted on the longer, becauſe it is a main one: Would ye then attain to the ground-work of humiliation, and obey this preſent Exhortation? Then take the threatnings of Gods Law and lay them before you, and meditate oft and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon them, and crave earneſtly the Spirit for that end, apply them to your ſelf, and ſuffer not your heart to ſhift them, and ſtrive to fear the Lords threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and to tremble at his Word; for our deceitfull hearts are very ready to ſhift them, to make a covenant with hell, and to put the evill day far from us; they have no will to hear ſuch harſh tydings; our ſouls ſhun this work of humiliation mightily; and the devill he is very buſie
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:121267:65"/>to ſteal out the fear of the Lords threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings out of our heart; for he knows that if he obtain that, he hath then made ſure work. He did ſo with our firſt parents, and prevailed; God threatned <hi>they ſhould dye;</hi> the devill ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not dye:</hi> and he was better beleeved then God. None of us but we will condemne our firſt parents in this, but fares it not even ſo with every one of us? The Lord hath added this threatning to every one of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; If thou do this, thou ſhalt ſurely dye; if thou ſwear thou ſhalt dye; if thou whore thou ſhalt dye; if thou lye thou ſhalt dye: and yet we ſtand not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe things: which thou durſt not do, didſt thou not beleeve the devill and thy own heart whiſpering into thee, that <hi>thou ſhalt not dye:</hi> thou beleeveſt the devill, and belyeſt God. But I intreat you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſtill beleeve the threatnings of Gods Word, that ſo ye may humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, as did good <hi>Joſiah</hi> when he heard the book of the Law, and that ye may ſtand in aw for times to come, and not ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond main and chief mean
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:121267:65"/>to bring us to humiliation, is, to conſider and meditate upon the Lords judgments ſet down in Scripture, adding withall the conſideration of Gods unchangeablenes, and how, as the Apoſtle ſaith, he <hi>is not an accepter of perſons,</hi> this ſurely is a notable mean: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My heart trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid becauſe of thy judgements.</hi> And did we conſider that we are guilty of the like (if not the ſame or greater) ſins, how would our hearts trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? There is no ſin almoſt but the Lord hath left a regiſtrate puniſhment for it in his Word, the more to humble us; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his bare Law and threatnings without execution would not affect us. How are we bound to him that teaches us in this manner by others harms: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. The Apoſtle brings in a number of inſtances of the Lords ſevere judgements againſt divers ſorts of ſinners, againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, murmurers, fornicators, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, luſters, &amp;c. and concludes, ſaying, <hi>Now all theſe things befell them for examples, and they are written for our inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world are fallen.</hi> The Scripture is full of other examples; and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:121267:66"/>ſurely now were not the hardneſſe of our hearts ſo extreamly great, I know not what could be more effectuall (the Lord concurring by his Spirit) to bring us to humiliation for our by-paſt ſins, and to cauſe us to ſtand in aw to ſin for times to come, then a deep and due conſideration of the judgements againſt ſinuers guiltie of the like tranſgreſſions and ſins with our ſelves. Adding withall, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the unchangeableneſſe of the Lord God, who dealt thus with them, and inflicted thoſe judgements upon them; for he being <hi>the ſame yesterday and to day, and for ever;</hi> there being no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe nor ſhadow of turning with him: he being <hi>no accepter of perſons,</hi> eſpecially thy ſins being greater. Then certainly how can the Lord but have the like quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with thee, as with them, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Thinkest thou, O man, that doeſt the ſame things, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God?</hi> how canſt thou think it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou think that thou haſt not to do with the ſame God, or that he is changed from that he was, and that he is not ſo offended at ſin now as he was of old, or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:121267:66"/>that he is an accepter of perſons? all which, or any of which to ſay, is very blaſphemous.</p>
               <p>Was the Lord ſo offended of old with the infidelitie, and with the impatiencie, and murmuring, and repining of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and did he puniſh it ſo ſeverely; and ſhalt thou for thy manifold delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies notwithſtanding thy by-paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and thy frequent repining againſt the Lords will, eſcape, unleſſe thou repent it, and humble thy ſelf, and amendi Did the Lord puniſh ſo ſharply <hi>Nadah</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for profaning his worſhip, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up ſtrange fire to him, and not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Lord when they came before him, and neer him? And doth not that ſame guiltineſſe lye upon thee, and hath not the Lord the ſame quarrel with thee, who ſo often haſt profaned his worſhip with hypocriſie and ſloth, drawing neer to him with the lips, but thy heart being far from him, but ſet upon thy vanities, and doing his work negligently, ruſhing in before him without ſanctifying thy ſelf when thou dreweſt neer him; yea coming with thy ſins upon thee, and ſo
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:121267:67"/>offering ſtrange fire to him many wayes; ſhall not the Lord puniſh thee alſo? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou humble thy ſelf and amend.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Did the Lord ſo peremptorily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the man who blaſphemed his Name, making him to be ſtoned to death; and ſhalt thou who haſt ſo often blaſphemed the holy and dreadfull Name of the Lord thy God, think that the Lord hath no quarrell againſt thee? and ſhall not puniſh thee? is he now leſſe offended then before? No: he hath told thee, but thou wilt not beleeve it, that he will not hold thee guiltleſſe, thou ſhalt not eſcape, unleſſe thou humble thy ſelf, and amend.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Was the Lord ſo zealous of keeping his Sabbath, that he cauſed that man that gachered ſome few ſticks to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death? Is there not then great wrath abiding thee, who ſo often haſt profaned his Sabbath, and doeſt ſo ſtill, unleſſe thou prevent his wrath by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and amendment?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Did the Lord expreſſe his anger in ſuch a degree againſt uncleanneſſe and fornication, that for it he made 23 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his people to fall in one day in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:121267:67"/>the wilderneſſe? and haſt thou not need to haſten and humble thy ſelf for thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes, or elſe the like anger is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Was he ſo offended with the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites for their luſting and intemperance in dyet, and not being content with the ſober dyet the Lord had allowed, that while the meat was in their mouthes, the Lords wrath fell upon them? and haſt thou not need to be truly humbled for thy manifold over-ſights in the point of diet and temperance, whether in eating or drinking?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Was <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> ſo fearfully puniſhed for their lying? and wilt thou make but a jeſt of it? Surely thou wouldſt condemne the Lord of crueltie, thou haſt need to eſteeme otherwiſe of it, to weigh it in the ballance of the ſanctuary, and to be humbled under the mightie hand of God for it.</p>
               <p>In a word, to conclude this point: <hi>Thinkeſt thou, O man, that doeſt the ſame things, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgement of God?</hi> Is the Lord changeable, or is he not as greatly offended now as then? or have we to do with another God, or will he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:121267:68"/>look to thy perſon more then to others? or are thy ſins leſſe then others? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thou muſt think, that thy heart trembleth not becauſe of theſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; what ever thy thought may be, aſſure thy ſelf, thou ſhalt find that they have the advantage of thee; if thou wilt look either to preeminencie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or greatneſſe of ſins: for the perſons, they were a <hi>naturall Olive,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and thou art but <hi>the wilde Olive: And if he ſpared not the naturall Olive, how little leſſe will he ſpare thee who art the wilde Olive?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if thou wilt compare their ſins and thine, thou wilt find thy own to be greater. For, 1. their ſins were againſt the Law onely, but thine are againſt the Goſpel; and for this conſider, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>If the Word ſpoken by Angels,</hi> &amp;c. 2. We read for the moſt part in all their exemplarie puniſhments, that it was but for one act of ſin onely; but which of thy ſins haſt thou not frequently committed, ſo that thou haſt contracted a cuſtome of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: This may be clearly ſeen, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the particulars before ſpoken of,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:121267:68"/>with our ſinning: He once brake the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, once blaſphemed, &amp;c. So that it is apparent thy ſins are the greater.</p>
               <p>This I ſpeak the rather, becauſe we have all ſhifting hearts, deceitfull above all things, which are ready to think that the ſins of thoſe who were exemplarily puniſhed, were greater then ours are, and that they had ſome extraordinary thing in them, which made the Lord extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to puniſh them, and ſo their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples work not ſo effectually upon us; but on the contrarie, ye ſee our ſins are clearly greater; Our Saviour ſaw this corruption and deceit of our hearts, and therefore he ſaies to the Jews, <hi>Think ye that theſe upon whom the Tower of Shiloh fell, were greater ſinners then the reſt;</hi> No ſaies he, they were not, <hi>But unleſſe ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> So ſay I to you, think not but thou art as great, yea a greater ſinner, and therefore <hi>unles thou repent, thou ſhalt periſh,</hi> unles thou humble and amend <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die the death;</hi> Was not the naturall Olive ſpared, and ſhalt thou? Was one act of ſin ſo ſeverely puniſhed; and ſhalt thou who haſt reiterated many

O but ſaieſt thou, how comes it to paſſe then, that the Lord deales otherwaies with ſinners now a daies then of old? for men do as it were get leave to ſin, and paſſe unpuniſhed. The Apoſtle gives the reaſon of this, in the words I cited before, ſaying, <hi>Theſe things befell them, that they might be examples to us, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> The reaſon that the Lord dealt more peremtorily with them, and more exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily was, not that their ſins were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ours leſſe, but becauſe they lived as it were in the beginning of the world, the Lord would make them examples for ſucceeding ages, he would let us ſee in the perſons of few, how he is offended with all, guilty of the like ſins; whereas with us living in the ends of the world, when examples ſhall be of leſſe uſe, and when the time of generall puniſhment is at hand, there is no reaſon that ſinners ſhould be preciſely and exemplarily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but yet thou ſhalt be as ſurely, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:121267:70"/>as ſeverely puniſhed, yea and more.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A third meane to helpe to humble us, is, to conſider the greatneſſe of Gods anger againſt ſin, and how odious ſin is in his ſight, and preſence, we ſhould firſt lay this ground, that our ſins provoke the Lord to anger and wrath, and then we ſhould conſider, how fearefull a thing the anger of the Lord is, for the firſt, it is clear, <hi>I a.</hi> 1. <hi>They have provoked the holy one of Iſrael to anger,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaies, that <hi>For theſe things, the wrath of God cometh upon the children of men,</hi> yea every ſin does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, and that moſt highly to wrath, although not all alike, yet certainly I ſay every one moſt high, or elſe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every ſin, would not be eternall, and intolerable torment; but ſo it is, and therfore every ſin, even the leaſt, provokes the Lord highly to wrath. Now this ground being laid for our humiliation, we ſhould conſider what a fearefull thing this wrath, and anger of God is, that we may be the more humble, ſeeing we our ſelves are lyable unto it. The Scripture ſets it down moſt fearfully, uſing ſtrange and fearful terms, not onely of anger, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:121267:71"/>wrath, but of indignation, of fury; and putting both in one, <hi>The furie of his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the fierceneſſe of his wrath</hi> The wiſe man ſaies, that <hi>the wrath of a King is like the roaring of a Lion:</hi> what then muſt be the wrath of the King of kings? for even theſe kings are adviſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. to <hi>kiſſe the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore we ſee how <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>Lord rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chaſten me in thy ſore diſpleaſure.</hi> It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the

               <p n="1">1. Muſt not the Lord be very angry, and highly offended with ſin, when for one ſin of our firſt parents he made whole mankinde lyable to eternall, and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable torment, the moſt part of them without recovery; and even upon whom he hath ſhewed mercie, he hath ordained them to paſſe their pilgrimage here in labour and ſorrow: and hath made all the creatures ſubiect to vanity; <hi>Who knows the power of his wrath?</hi> But this ye may think was againſt ſin committed in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, when there was ſuch ability not to ſin.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, behold afterwards the Lords anger againſt ſin how great it muſt be; when for ſin he who ſwears he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in the death of a ſinner, and is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:121267:72"/>a God full of compaſſion, did deſtroy the whole world, the very young ſucking ones, and the dumbe creatures, a few onely being ſaved?

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:121267:72"/>move ſo juſt a God (who ſurely would not make the puniſhment greater then the fault) to adjudge the committer to eternall torment, and intollerable.</p>
               <p>O! if this were well weighed by us, we would not be ſo careleſſe in preventing, nor ſo ſlight in our humiliation, even for, our leaſt ſins; we all fail in this, we are not carefull enough to prevent ſmall ſins, (ſo to ſpeak) nor carefull enough to humble our ſelves for them; we have a caſt of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now to conclude this point: would ye ſee the Lords anger, hatred, &amp; ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſt ſin, yet more clearly; adde but this one conſideration, to wit, of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even with his own children, his own darlings, after the committing of ſin, to whom nevertheleſſe he hath pardoned
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:121267:73"/>the iniquitie; how dealt he with <hi>David</hi> the man according to his own heart? how with <hi>Moſes</hi> who was ſo familiar with him? for one ſin deprives him of his greateſt worldly contentment: he wounds them with the wound of an enemie, and chaſtiſes them with the chaſtiſement of a cruell one, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith; he makes their beauty to conſume as a moth, night and day his hand is heavy upon them, and he turns their moiſture into the drought of Summer. Now if the Lord for ſin deal ſo with his own dear children, how will he do with his enemies? if ſo ſharply with them, to whom he hath pardoned the ſin, how then with thoſe who are ſtill guilty? if ſo to the green tree, how to the dry? <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, how ſhall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and ſinners be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IIII. A fourth mean or help of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is, to conſider ſeriouſly of the juſtice of God; a point alſo that we can never ſufficiently comprehend: people apprehend the Lord to be infinitely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and ſo he is; but for his Juſtice they eſteeme nothing ſo of it, as if he were not infinitely juſt alſo: every thing in God is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:121267:73"/>infinite, and therefore he being juſt, muſt of neceſſitie be infinite in his Juſtice; and ſo his juſtice, think we of it what we will, paſſes our deepeſt apprehenſion. Take heed unto this, ye that think the Lord is all Mercie; the Lords mercie is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full great, God forbid it were otherwiſe, <hi>His mercie</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>reaches to the heavens, and his faithfulneſſe to the clouds.</hi> But doth not his juſtice and judgement reach as far? for what ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>O the depth of the riches, &amp;c.</hi> and addes the ſame of his juſtice, for he ſaith, <hi>His Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are paſt finding out.</hi> And as he ſpeaks of the glory of his mercy upon the veſſels of mercy; ſo he ſpeaks of his wrath, even the power of his wrath upon the veſſels of wrath: ſo that with whom he deals in mercie, he is infinitely mercifull; and with whom he deals in juſtice, he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely juſt.</p>
               <p>And let me ſay to you, if we will look to the multitude of objects, Juſtice hath the preheminence; I ſpeak this to humble you, and alſo that ye be not deceived: for men and women think that Mercie hath the upper hand of Juſtice in this reſpect,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:121267:74"/>but <hi>many are called, and few are choſen.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mercy bears it away in this, that it hath the firſt place, and Juſtice comes not in till Mercie be contemned, patience and long-ſuffering abuſed, and towards Gods own it is wonderfull; for all their ſins may well make him to viſit them with the rods of men, but never to take his tender mercie from them.</p>
               <p>But for the point I was ſpeaking of, certainly more ſhal find the dint of Gods juſtice, then ever ſhall find the benefit of his mercie; which ſhould cauſe every one of us in good earneſt to ſee to our ſelves. The Scripture is very carefull, that the conſideration of Gods mercie do not ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe his juſtice from our eyes; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe two notable places, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. and <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. which two places ſpeak very gloriouſly of Gods mercie, yet in both of them are interwoven theſe two peremptory ſpeeches of Gods juſtice: In the one, <hi>He will by no means clear the guilty;</hi> in the other, <hi>He will not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the wicked. Joſh.</hi> 24.19, 20. when he was ſtirring up the Iſraelites to ſerve and worſhip the Lord their God, he was loath
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:121267:74"/>that they ſhould miſtake the nature of him whom they undertook to ſerve, that they ſhould conceive (as people are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do) God to be all good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and mercifull; and therefore he tels them what a one he is, not denying the former, but putting them in mind of that which they were readie to forget: what ſaith he, <hi>He is an holy God, he is a jealous G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> a point very conſiderable for thy continuall humiliation. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:121267:75"/>men do ſcarcely apprehend that the Lords juſtice and anger for their ſins can reach to themſelves; but ye ſhall find it hath extended to others: one man ſinned, and the Lord was wroth with the whole congregation. If this were conſidered, as I told you before, we ſhould take better heed to our ſelves then we do, and take better heed to the repreſſing of ſin. <hi>Wo is me,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>for I dwell among a people of polluted lips;</hi> ſtrange is the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of ſin. This makes <hi>David</hi> to ſay, that he will take order with his family, <hi>No wicked perſon will I know, and they that do evill ſhall depart from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. A fifth mean of humiliation, is a ſetting our ſins in order before our ſelves, that is, to have a due and deep weighing of our ſins in their greatneſſe, number, manner, and ſuch other circumſtances of aggravation.

This neglecting the Lords call, and refuſing to hear his Word, and obey it, is a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſin, and fearfully threatned in Gods Word: <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye have not heard, and have ſtretched forth mine hand, and no man regarded; But ye have ſet at nought my counſell, and would have none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:121267:81"/>and mock when your fear cometh. Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer: they ſhall ſeek me early, but ſhall not find me.</hi> There cannot be a more fearfull threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then this, and yet ye ſee it is but juſt and proportionable; which ſhews the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to be exceeding great. And indeed, how great a ſin muſt it be, that the great God ſhould vouchſafe to ſpeak to us, baſe creatures, and that thou in the mean time ſhouldſt not daigne to hear him, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, refuſe to obey him? Now this thou haſt done ſo often as ever thou hadſt the occaſion of the Word, and either ſlighted to hear, or didſt not do the thing thou heardſt. Thou muſt not think that it was a man onely that thou didſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard to hear, or to obey, but even God himſelf, whoſe Ambaſſadour he is. O that we would conſider this rightly, that when we hear the Word, it is the great God whom we hear, or whom we miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, according to that of the Apoſtle; that <hi>they received the Word, not as the word of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>, as it is indeed, the Word of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This would make us truly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:121267:81"/>the greatneſſe of our by-paſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in this point, and for time to come, to hear with greater attention, &amp; to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe: but becauſe this is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible enough conſidered by us, therefore is it, that we cannot ſee the greatneſſe of this ſin, to wit, to heare the word of God negligently. This ſinne is alſo fearfully threatned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 12.66.4. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.13. all which ſhewes that the contempt, yea neglect of Gods word, is not ſo ſmall a ſin as we apprehend it to be, how then ſhouldeſt thou be humbled, who haſt been ſo often guilty of this ſin; See we not when Malefactors are broght to the place of the execution, even for crying ſins, that yet this ſin cries louder in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then all the reſt, as is to be ſeen by their confeſſions: further conſider, how thou haſt ſinned not onely in generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of Gods word, but even in particular againſt the Goſpel, againſt the offer of mercy, and haſt neglected ſo great a ſalvation; Now this makes thy ſins to be exceeding ſinfull, it is fearfull to ſin againſt the very light of nature, as is clear by the teſtimonies of the Lords
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:121267:82"/>wrath upon <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5. and upon theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. They had but the very light of nature, and yet becauſe they abuſed, even but that light, becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankfull, therefore he gave them over to a reprobate minde; and far more fearfull is it to ſin againſt the light of the written Law, for that was a clearer light; and ſo we ſee the tranſgreſſors of the Law were preciſely and peremptorily puniſhed, every tranſgreſſion received a juſt recompence of reward: But moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſinfull of all is it, to ſin againſt the moſt clear light of the Goſpel, and the offer of ſalvation in it, as is clear out of theſe two places: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. And our Saviour ſaith plainly, that <hi>it ſhall be eaſier in the day of judgement even for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Gomorrah,</hi> then it ſhall be for the neglecters of the Goſpel. Conſider then how thou haſt ſinned in this laſt kind, and ſo how great thy ſins muſt be; Were the breakers of the Law ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea even thoſe who had nothing but the light of nature? O what deſerveſt thou? what need haſt thou to be humbled,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:121267:82"/>that haſt ſinned againſt the higheſt light? if by humiliation thou do not prevent it, it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom then for thee.</p>
               <p>Now the thing, that makes ſins againſt the Goſpel to be ſo ſinfull, is this: becauſe they are againſt, not onely the Lords Commandment, but his moſt loving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and that by his tender mercies, and the precious merits of his Son, and therefore notwithſtanding theſe, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, and ſo to deſpiſe the offer of grace, is and muſt be exceedingly ſinfull; for it is no leſſe then, as the Apoſtle cals it, to neglect ſo great a ſalvation, to tread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet the blood of Chriſt, and to count the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing: for by the Law the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us indeed ſo to do, but the tenor of the Goſpel is, by intreating to win obedience out of love: <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God.</hi> Rom. 12.1. If a juſt King ſhould out of Authority command his Subject any reaſonable lawfull thing, and he ſhould diſobey, certainly his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience were great, and greatly to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; But if the Prince laying aſide his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:121267:83"/>Authoritie, or with his Authority, ſhould requeſt, and allure with benefits, and yet be neglected, what puniſhment thinkeſt thou were that perſon worthy of? Now the caſe is thy own, the Lord thy God hath more intereſt in thee, then all the kings in the world, and is more worthy to be obeyed then they all; alſo he hath been commanding thee, and not onely ſo, but requeſting, beſeeching thee, and that not by any common favours, but by his tender mercies, and the precious merits of his Son, and renewing the offer of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and remiſſion of thy ſins, to leave ſuch and ſuch ſins, and to do ſuch and ſuch duties, but thou wouldeſt not: O then how great, and how juſt ſhall be thy damnation? is not this to tread under feet the blood of Chriſt? O that this were conſidered: if a Subject ſhould rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Prince, his puniſhment ſhould be both juſt and great; But if the Prince notwithſtanding all that had paſt, would of his free grace offer him a free remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pardon, and intreat him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, and no more to continue in his rebellion; and yet nevertheleſſe he ſhould
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:121267:83"/>deſpiſe the pardon, and continue in his former rebellion, what puniſhment can be deviſed ſufficient for ſuch a one? Juſt ſuch is the caſe of ſuch who ſin againſt the Goſpel, the Lord offers freely to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all former ſins, and rebellions, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as juſtly he might have puniſhed them before: <hi>Let the wicked man forſake his wayes,</hi> &amp;c. and yet for all this they neglect ſo great ſalvation, they deſpiſe the offer of mercie, and ſin againſt the Lords cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie.</p>
               <p>Theſe be our own actuall ſins, that we ought to humble our ſelves for; but there be other ſins that we ought in no wiſe to paſſe by in our humiliation, to wit, 1. for our originall corruption, that lothſome leproſie, that ugly filthy corruption, that falling ſickneſſe of our ſins, the fountain of all our naturall ſins, which defiles, not onely our actions, but our very perſons in the ſight of God; and is ſo much to be deplored, being a diſeaſe incurable in the inward or noble parts, and is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented above any out-breakings in the outward parts of the body: we ſee how <hi>David,</hi> how <hi>Paul</hi> bewails it. 2.

               <p n="6">VI. The laſt and a notable mean of humiliation is, well to conſider the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt whom thou haſt ſinned, and that both in his greatneſſe, and in his goodneſſe towards thee. This did <hi>David</hi> weigh and conſider, while he ſaith ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, <hi>Againſt thee, even againſt thee have I ſinned.</hi> And indeed without weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this point, we can hardly either be humbled in our ſelves, or can we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, or with our hearts acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the juſtice of God. But ſeeing and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:121267:85"/>conſidering this point, to wit, againſt whom we have ſinned, our conſcience will then exceedingly both condemne our ſelves, and juſtifie the Lord in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that doth aggravate an offence more then doth the qualitie of the perſon againſt whom it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that which being done by a man againſt an ordinary perſon, one of his neighbours, would be but an ordinarie offence; yet if he ſhould do it to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it would turn to a hainous crime; and if it were done to his Prince, it would be high treaſon, deſerving and procuring the utmoſt degree of puniſhment that could be deviſed; how great then muſt be the offence, and what ſhall be the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of that offence which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the great God, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord of all the earth, the King of kings, who is able to caſt both ſoul and body into hel fire? But eſpecially, I would have thee to conſider the goodneſſe of God, that ſo thou mayeſt ſee the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ingratitude of thy ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſo mayeſt juſtifie the Lord
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:121267:86"/>in his juſtice. If a man ſhould go &amp; wrong or offend his father that begat him, and gave him his life; or one that at any time had preſerved his life; or one that had beſtowed ſome great favour upon him, and had been beneficiall to him, we would abhor ſuch a man for the foulnes, the unnaturalneſſe, the ingratitude of his offence; But what is this to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Lord our God? he is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed, and the Father, not onely of our bodies, but, as he is called, of our ſpirits; it is he, that hath made us, and not we our ſelves; He hath preſerved our life, not once, but many times, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; <hi>In him we live, we move, we have our being.</hi> And finally, he hath beſtowed upon us favours innumerable, is ſo beneficiall, that he loads us daily with his benefits: what vile ingratitude then muſt it be to fin againſt him? I pray thee, how migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and withall how juſt a challenge ſhall it be, when the Lord ſhall accuſe thee in theſe terms, I did make thee, who might have denyed thee a being, and I made thee according to my own Image; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I might have made thee a beaſt, or a

               <p>Q. <hi>VVHat be the Marks that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company faith, or are taken from the concomitants of Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I. They be theſe three eſpecially, the firſt is this: true Faith leans to the means, and is grounded upon them, even upon the Word of God, and in ſpeciall upon the promiſes of forgiveneſſe of ſins; the new and everlaſting Covenant, the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Gods mercifull nature, Chriſts rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to receive ſinners, the oath, that ground of ſtrong conſolation, and ſuch like grounds and means of confidence layed down in the Word, it is begotten and bred by theſe at firſt; it is fed, cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtrengthened by theſe. And laſtly, it is defended by theſe againſt all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, doubtings, and tentations of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:121267:87"/>ſoul; ſo that the Word, and theſe things in the Word, be the ſeed, the food, the fortreſſe, or refuge of faith, whereunto it retyres; ſo that faith altogether ſtands by the Word: <hi>Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God:</hi> Rom. 10.27. So then, wouldſt thou know whether thy faith be of the right ſtamp, or no: 1. Was thy faith at firſt begotten by the Word, and the foreſaid means either heard, read, or meditated upon? 2. Doeſt thou find thy faith to be ſtrengthened, cheriſhed, and cheered by uſing the ſame means; ſo that upon your diligent uſing and feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, you find your faith more lively and ſtrong: and again, upon your neglect of the means, you find it more dead, weak, and remiſſe? this is very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And, 3. when your faith is put to it, and aſſaulted, doth it and thy heart flie to the foreſaid means and paſſages of Gods Word? all this evidences thy faith to be of the right ſtamp. And eſpecially if thou knoweſt the very particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and clauſes of the Word which did firſt beget faith in thee, which ſtrengthen thee in thy weakneſſe, and whereunto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:121267:88"/>thy faith retyres in time of aſſaults, (for this Gods children do) but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 1. knoweſt thou not, rememberſt thou not, how or by what means thy faith was begotten? 2. Findeſt thou thy faith all alike when thou uſeſt the means, and when thou uſeſt them not, or never uſeſt any at all? And 3. if thou ſhouldſt be put to it, haſt thou no other warrant for thy faith, but thy own phantaſie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or imagination, that ſandie foundation, but doeſt want a particular warrant from Gods Word? then be ſure thy faith is but counterfeit, it cannot be well come, that we cannot tell how it is come. And it is ſtrange for a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that he ſhall have ſuch a thing for ſuch a man, and yet hath never had his word, nor hand for it: So is it with the point in hand. Thus ye ſee the firſt Mark, true Faith alwayes leans to, and holds by the Means; whereas Preſumption neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the Means.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Let me have another of theſe Marks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>A.</hi> Another is this: true Faith is accompanied with frequent doubtings; whereas Preſumption never doubts.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:121267:88"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>How prove you this Mark, and how is the truth of it evidenced and cleared?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thus: if faith be true, then ſure the devill envies ſo precious a pearl, and is evermore caſting his fiery darts at it, ſo to rob us of it, or at leaſt to impede our comfort: Whereas on the other ſide, if it be but preſumption, he knows it will not do the turn, he lets it alone; <hi>When the ſtrong man holds the houſe, all things are at peace.</hi> Secondly, the Lord will have his own exerciſed; will a man plant a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and not eat the fruit thereof? The application is eaſie. Art thou, or haſt thou been ſubject to doubting? this is a token thy faith is true, and otherwiſe Satan would not trouble it: but certainly haſt thou never doubted, thou haſt never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A third Mark is, whereas Faith or beleeving is <hi>A receiving of Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. <hi>To ſo many as received him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>even to thoſe who beleeues in his Name.</hi> True faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt rightly upon the terms that he offers himſelf, that is, as it caſts over upon Chriſt the burthen of it's ſins, ſo it is content to take up the eaſie yoke of his
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:121267:89"/>obedience, in doing or ſuffering; to <hi>take up the croſſe and follow him:</hi> for theſe be the termes whereon Chriſt offers himſelf. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. Now preſumption makes termes of it's own, thinks to have Chriſt to take the burthen of their ſins, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks upon the taking on the yoke of his obedience. The application here alſo is very eaſie.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou with thy cleaving to Chriſt for the remiſſion of thy ſins, reſolved to take on alſo the yoke of his obedience, in doing and ſuffering, and doeſt thou it, in fighting againſt thy moſt pleaſant ſins, and cleaving to the hardeſt duties, with denying thy ſelf; then be ſure thou haſt rightly received Chriſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rightly beleeved; thou haſt made him thy Lord, and he ſhall be thy Saviour: thou haſt made him thy King, and he ſhal be thy Prieſt; thou makeſt conſcience of the precepts of the Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt intereſt, and ſhall have thy comfort in the promiſes. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thou, who ever thou be, who thinkſt that thou beleeveſt in Chriſt, and in the mean time liveſt as thou pleaſeſt, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:121267:89"/>the broad and eaſie way of thy own heart, and the cuſtomes of an evil world, and not the ſtrait way of Chriſts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; thy faith is but preſumption: Go ſeek true faith, ſeek it earneſtly, and thou ſhalt find it; but it will not be eaſily got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: how thankfull ſhould they be, who have found the way unto it?</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Which be the Marks that follow faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Sundrie. Though the Spirit of God inſiſts upon two eſpecially, to wit, the love of the brethren, and obedience unto Gods Commandments. 1. Then, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto Gods Commandments is ſet down moſt frequently in Scripture for a mark of faith and regeneration: this is the Lords ſeal, <hi>to depart from iniquitie,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul; Shew me thy faith by thy works,</hi> ſaith <hi>James.</hi> And our Saviour, <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>John's</hi> firſt Epiſtle, it is often inculcated, Chap. 1. <hi>If we walk in darkneſſe, and ſay we have fellowſhip with him, we lye, and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, then we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Now what is it to walk in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:121267:90"/>the light, but to walk according to the rule of Gods Word, which the Scripture cals <hi>a lantern to our paths,</hi> and this is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Gods Commandments: So Chap. 2. <hi>Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the naturall man, the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, will go far in the point of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and every one hath ſome meaſure of obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is true, and therefore we muſt be carefull to ſee the ſoundneſſe and rightneſſe of our obedience by theſe Marks, which are not to be found in the naturall mans obedience. 1. He whoſe obedience is ſound, makes conſcience of ſecret ſins, and ſecret duties, betwixt God and him, as well as of publick ſins, and of publick duties; he is as loath to intertain a ſinfull thought in his heart, as to commit a ſinfull deed before the eyes of the world; is as well carefull to diſcharge thoſe duties which are to be done ſecretly in his cloſet between his God and his own ſoul; as of the publick which are to be done in the Church: this is a token of the true fear of God, and of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:121267:90"/>true reſpect to him. 2. He whoſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſound, makes conſcience of ſmall ſins, (I mean that are ſmall in the eyes of the world) as of great; for he knows eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin highly offends God, and deſerves eternall damnation: he knows he who ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> he ſaid alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſwear;</hi> whereas the unſound obeyer, uſes to weigh ſin in the ballance of mans eſtimation, and not in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary; from whence it is, that he makes ſmall account of many ſins, as of a ſmall ordinary oath, to ſpeak corrupt communication, to let it ſlip in merriment, to lye for recreation, &amp;c. this is not to walk according to that rule, <hi>Thou haſt commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.</hi> 3. A ſound obeyer makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Gods Commands, even thoſe which moſt controuls his profit, pleaſure, or credit. But the unſound obeyer he will with <hi>Herod,</hi> do many things; but when the duty comes once to croſſe, controll, or be in competition with any of theſe, there he ſticks, namely, if it come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with that of theſe, that is his god, his idoll, which he moſt looks to;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:121267:91"/>How few ſanctifie the Sabbath as it ought, or takes pains in private exerciſes of devotion? why, theſe controull their pleaſure, and lazineſſe: How few are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable? why, this controuls their profit. How few will ſuffer or ſit down with a wrong without repaying, though the Scripture be moſt expreſſe? O this touches them in their great Idoll their Credit. And for this ſame reaſon, how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline good duties, not making their light ſhine before men? <hi>He that is aſhamed of me before men,</hi> &amp;c. all this is againſt the rule, <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have reſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He whoſe obedience is ſound, makes conſcience not onely of the doing of a duty, but alſo of the manner of the doing of it; and is humbled for his failings in the manner, as well as for the omiſſion. But the hypocrite ſo he do the duty, he regards not the manner, he cares not for it; ſo he pray, hear, read, he reſts there, but cares not to do all theſe, with that reverence, cheerfulneſſe, diligence, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ſinceritie which the Lord requires in the diſcharge of his worſhip; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:121267:91"/>not the rule, <hi>The wayes of a man ſeem good in his own eyes, but the Lord ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart.</hi> But eſpecially in the manner of our obedience we ſhould look to the motive and end of our obedience, to that which puts us on to do it, and which we ſet before our eyes, that it be not a wrong motive, but the fear of God, yea the love of God; and the end, to pleaſe God, and not our ſelves, or others: But of this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Mark of Faith, is, the love of Gods Children. <hi>By this we know that we are tranſlated from death to life, if we love the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> And if it be a reall love, hereby we aſſure our ſelves before him; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, all his delight was this way; this is a Mark which hath upholden many when they have been at a very lowe ebbe, and when other Marks have not been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to them; thoſe who are truly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they have this wrought in their hearts by Gods Spirit, a ſecret diſpoſition to love goodneſſe, and thoſe who are good, an evident token they are in ſome meaſure ſo themſelves, for like, loves like, ſo they love thoſe who are holy, and the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:121267:92"/>more holy they love them, the better they love them; yea they more account of a ſpark of holineſſe, then all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall accompliſhments. Whereas the wicked, though they may carry a fair ſhew to the godly, yet indeed they hate them, they are thorns in their eyes. Now this Mark ſhould be rightly conſidered, leſt any that have not intereſt ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, and lay hold of it. One may love ſome good men, becauſe they have been ſome way obliged to them; but ſee, if thou loveſt all goodneſſe, and all good men, yea thoſe whom thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kneweſt, but by report.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One may love good men, becauſe of their natural and moral endowments, as kindneſſe, courteſie, wiſdom, affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, &amp;c. but look if thou love them for their pietie, and holineſſe; look if thou loveſt holineſſe where it wants there na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and morall indowments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations; if thou loveſt not onely a wiſe good man, but even alſo a ſimple good man, not only a good man of ſome place and reputation in the world, but even alſo a mean good man, and the like:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:121267:92"/>yea look if thou loveſt holineſſe, &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe not onely when, and where it is without the advantage of naturall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, but even alſo where it hath great diſadvantages in regard of theſe, as when a man wants that meaſure of naturall wiſdom that is requiſite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to have, through the weakneſſe of his mind; and wants that meaſure of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability and amiableneſſe that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite through the naturall temper of his body: look, I ſay, if in ſuch a caſe thou loveſt his goodneſſe, pietie, and holines, and not take prejudice againſt it, but art ſuch a one, who doeſt love and honour them that fear the Lord: this Mark in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is ſet down ſomewhat different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we muſt try our ſelves by this. It's true, great men muſt have the outward reſpect, their place ſpeaks <hi>honour to whom honour;</hi> but for the inward reſpect of the heart we ſhould ſee, whether greatneſſe or goodneſſe carries it away. Certainly thoſe who have gotten their judgements rectified and renewed, to diſcern things that differ, or have their hearts ſet upon the purſuit of grace, will eſteeme more of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:121267:93"/>it where it is, then of all the greatneſſe in the world.</p>
               <p>A third Mark is this: faith purifieth the heart, which may carry with it a double meaning, to wit, either this, that whereas the hipocrite looks onely to the outward man, but not to the hidden man of the heart, true faith it does far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; for knowing, that it has to do with the alſeeing God, the tryer of the heart, and the ſearcher of the reines, he ſtrives to keep clean his heart, and to take heed to the thoughts of his heart, aſwell as to his outward actions; every one that hath this hope, purifieth himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But, ſecondly, This is not all, faith purifieth the heart, that is, makes a man not onely make conſcience of the thoughts and diſpoſition of his heart to purifie them, but even alſo helps him to purifie it, and purge it from the ſeverall corruptions, of it, for through faith we get victory over al corruptions, this is our victory, even our faith, &amp; by it we draw vertue from Chriſt to cure our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that faith by little, and little, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the heart throughout.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:121267:93"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O then I cannot have faith, for I finde my heart ſwarming with wicked, and impure thoughts, many great and groſſe corruptions, and ſome of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong and indeed predominant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That thy heart, as thou thinkſt, is ſo full of corruptions, is not that thy heart is more impure then others, but that thou haſt a cleerer light, and better ſight of the corruption of thy own heart, then others have; thy heart was once more uncleane when thou ſaweſt it not' to be ſo; now when thou ſeeſt theſe ſmall moats, it is a token the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath ſhined upon thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That faith purifies the heart, muſt be rightly underſtood, for the meaning is not, that faith does altogether purge, and free the heart from ſin, who can ſay his heart is clean? but this faith puts a clean purifying diſpoſition into the heart ſo that it either reſiſts it, or rejects ſin, or works it out, although there be much of the filthines of ſin, yet it ſtill fights againſt it, gainſtanding it, working it out, even as clean liquor does every unclean thing, honey for example, or as oyle will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:121267:94"/>or as wine above the dregs, when faith is in the heart, the heart will not harbour ſin, thus it is ſaid, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart,</hi> if there be never ſo much ſinfulneſſe in the heart, yet if thou wouldeſt be quit of it: diſlike it, loath it, cry againſt it, judge thy ſelf for it: thou haſt reaſon indeed to ſorrow for it, but not to diſpair or be diſcouraged; yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get more faith, that thou maieſt get a further victorie and purification.</p>
               <p>And, thirdly, For that predominant corruption, that thou canſt not get ridd of, but in all thy doings it cleaves unto thee, pollutes thy beſt ſervices, this ſhould not diſcourage thee: for, 1. This is the caſe of Gods children, they have ſin that hangeth faſt on them, yea even <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, <hi>When I would do good, evill is preſent with me,</hi> and cries out againſt the <hi>body of death.</hi> And 2. But if thou fall out with, and loath thy ſin, if thou regard it not, if thou judge thy ſelf for it, fear not, thou ſhalt not be judged for it: if thou cry to God againſt it, thou ſhalt not be found guilty no more then the woman under the Law; it is not thou, but ſin that dwelleth in thee. If thou
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:121267:94"/>think it ſtrange that the Lord ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thee with ſuch ſtrong corruptions, ſo diſpleaſing to himſelf, he doth it for good ends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To cure a more dangerous corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to bring thee out of conceit of thy own righteouſneſſe, to chaſe thee to his Chriſt for expiation, and to the holy Ghoſt for mortification of corruption, to exerciſe thee in praier, and in thy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an warfare, were it not for this, we would not ſo often, and ſo fully, feele the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and ſweetneſſe of Chriſts ſufferings, interceſſion, and righteouſneſſe; we would not make ſo much of the ſanctifying, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing power of the holy Ghoſt, nor have ſo oft recourſe unto it, where would be the exerciſe of our faith and patience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the performance of the promiſe of ſanctification? what would ſtir us up to fervent and ſincere prayer, where ſhould be the matter of our Chriſtian warfare?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I do not finde the hatred and loathing of ſin, and this doth puzzle me in this point, I find indeed, that I do not entertain it, but I think it to be more out of fear of puniſhment, then out of hatred of ſin.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:121267:95"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Doth not thy heart riſe againſt ſin, even in others, to whoſe ſin thou art not acceſſarie, which cannot flow from fear, but from hatred? yea, doeſt thou not hate thoſe who are profain, and wicked, although they have other recommending and inſinuating parts? as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thou loveſt thoſe who are good, and holy? ſay not then that thou art altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voyd of this point of the hatred of ſin; further, though we finde not all that we would have, yet ſhould not we faile to be both thankfull and incouraged, in regard of the things that we finde, the Lord gives us to find many things, that we may be exerciſed in thankfulneſſe, and to miſſe ſome things that we may be exerciſed in prayer, pray then that the Lord more and more, would make thee partaker of his divine nature, and of his holineſſe, that ſo the hatred of ſin may grow more and more ſenſible in you, for he is of <hi>purer eyes then that he can behold iniquity, Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>He loveth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hateth wickedneſſe; Pſa.</hi> 55.7.</p>
               <p>A fourth Mark, faith worketh by love: Wherefore obſerve two things of faith.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:121267:95"/>1. That it worketh, it is operative, and not idle, it brings with it a ſpirituall life unto the ſoul of man, and this ſpirituall life brings out ſpiritual operations; when faith is put in the heart of a man, there is a ſtirring diſpoſition put in his heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, he is not his own man, in his own ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, finds not quietneſſe in his mind, unleſſe he be ſometimes working, and well employed: Faith ever worketh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God (I mean, immediately, for all our works are to him as to our laſt end) in being about the points of his worſhip, in obeying his acceptable will, in glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name, advancing his kingdom, ſeeing to the doing of his will by others, ſo far as opportunitie and our callings permit. Sometimes towards our ſelves in that great work of our ſalvation: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times towards our Neighbours in the works of charitie, yea of ſpirituall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſo neceſſary, and ſo often recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <hi>Exhort, inſtruct, edifie, comfort, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh one another,</hi> and yet neglected, much want of compaſſion to the poore ſoul; So their faith is ever working, which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cuts off thoſe who pleaſe themſelves,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:121267:96"/>that they abſtain from ill, yea from ſome few groſſe ills, that they are no theeves, murtherers, adulterers, &amp;c. although they never do a good deed, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the doome of the unfruitfull tree, and unprofitable ſervants.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, as it worketh, ſo it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love: there is much working upon wrong motives, which is all loſt labour, like building without a foundation; there is nothing we ſhould look more unto then this, what is the motive of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for it is the thing the Lord looks moſt unto; <hi>He pondereth the heart:</hi> yea, doth not man ſo alſo, if he can know it? Now the motive moſt acceptable to God, the diſpoſition and affection of the heart which he requires, which is here a Mark of Faith, is the motive of love; the Lord cares not a whit for our obedience if it come not from love, yea he reckons it not for obedience; therefore <hi>Love is the ſumme of the Law,</hi> it fulfils the Law; it is <hi>the end of the Law, Even love out of a pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſhews mercy unto thouſands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments. If I give my body to be burnt, and beſtow all my
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:121267:96"/>goods upon the poore, without love, it profiteth nothing.</hi> Love is the ſoul, the ſalt of all obedience; and without it it is but a dead unſavoury carkaſſe. Hence is it, that the Lord doth begin his Law (the ſumme of all our obedience) with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and the rehearſall of a main tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall favour and deliverance, typifying a far greater, even that great ſalvation which ſhews that he would have the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience rendered unto his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to flow from love. This is alſo the way of the Goſpel, even the way of love, and the commands thereof are rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts then commands. <hi>I beſeech you by the mercies of God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. <hi>We beſeech you, exhort you by the Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. and in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie other places; So that the Goſpel doth require a lovely obedience, and would draw us by the cords of love. And this certainly makes our obligation of obedience the greater, and our guiltines the greater if we obey not: If one who may command, will yet intreat, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience is ſo much the fouler, and more odious. And this is indeed to ſin againſt the Goſpel, and to neglect that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:121267:97"/>great ſalvation, to wit, when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and beſought by him who hath all power and right to command us, and that not by common favours, but <hi>by the mercies of God,</hi> and <hi>ſufferings of Chriſt,</hi> and yet refuſe to obey. But to the point.</p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou then render an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obedience, let the ſenſe of the Lords great, and many temporall and ſpirituall favours and deliverances, be ever freſh and firm in thy minde, but eſpecially the ſenſe of that great deliverance, that great ſalvation ſo dearly purchaſed, that theſe may ſtir up thy love, and love may be the motive of thy obedience; And by reaſon that love flows from faith, above all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to hold thy faith ſtirring, and in action. Thus did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 26. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is ever before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Paul: The love of Chriſt conſtraineth me:</hi> to this end, be earneſt with the Lord, that according to his promiſe, he would circumciſe thy heart, and cauſe thee to love him with the whole heart, that by the holy Ghoſt his love may be ſhed abroad in thy ſoul. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. that he would give unto thee to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:121267:97"/>be <hi>rooted and grounded in love.</hi> Epheſ. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I find not my ſelf right in this point, for I find not this love and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, but rather do, becauſe I dare not do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This Mark indeed ſhould be wiſely conſidered by weak Chriſtians, who are in their beginning eſpecially, or under tentation, deſertion, affliction. Nor is it a ſenſible Mark for all Chriſtians at all times; but a mark of Faith ſomewhat ſtrengthened, when the heart is beſet with tentations, deſertion, or affliction. This working by love wil not be ſenſible, although it be ſecret: further, eſpecially in the beginnings of Chriſtianitie, it is not ſenſible; for the underſtanding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, conſider, that there is three ſorts of motives of obedience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One altogether wrong, having no eye to God; So to eſchew the ill opinion of man, many do ſundrie good duties, and become neighbour like in outward duties of outward obedience: Others to win the praiſe of man, will go beyond their neighbours; yea poſſibly beyond good Chriſtians. There be ſundry other
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:121267:98"/>by-reſpects, and many by-roads in the hearts of naturall men and hypocrites.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of Motives is that which is in the hearts of beginning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which is not altogether right, and yet ſome way right, as introductorie to right, as having an eye to God, and as joyned with ſome weak faith, and ſome inſenſible love; this is the Motive of fear flowing from the ſpirit of bondage, which having taken a deep impreſſion in them, and their faith being but weak and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering, as yet prevails with them, and is the moſt ſenſible motive that puts them on; they do, becauſe they dare not do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, becauſe they fear Gods juſtice, and have a wakening in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And yet this is not altogether wrong, for the reſpects aforeſaid. For why doth the Lord denounce ſo many threatnings and judgements but for this, and that all theſe ſhould have their own place with us? yea, why is our obedience ſo often wakened up by rods, croſſes and afflictions, if this ſort of fear were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wrong? But as faith and love grows ſtrong, by little and little they caſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:121267:98"/>out fear: And ſo comes the third Motive, even that acceptable motive of love. This is that which St. <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>v.</hi> 18. hath, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>fect love caſteth out fear:</hi> and again, <hi>He that feareth, is not made perfect in love.</hi> So that to work out of fear doth not argue no love, and ſo no faith, but onely that thou art not made perfect in love, becauſe of the weakneſſe of thy faith: Labour then to ſtrengthen thy faith, that it may have more love, for it flows from faith, and is according to the meaſure of thy faith, grows as faith grows, and do not give place to that main policie of Satan, and ordinarie and incident weakneſſe of many Chriſtians, to darken thy faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou findeſt thy love weak. But as for thee, that either workeſt not at all, or if thou doeſt any thing, it ariſes from wrong motives and ends, from cuſtome, and not from conſcience; to pleaſe men, and not to pleaſe God; neither feareſt him, nor loveſt him; thou haſt no faith, and ſo art in a miſerable condition.</p>
               <p>A fifth Mark and effect of Faith, is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall peace and joy; for peace, being juſtified by faith, <hi>We have peace with God
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:121267:99"/>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> For joy; <hi>In whom beleeving we rejoyce with joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and glorious.</hi> And both together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y and peace in beleeving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But hath not the wicked and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man peace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> True, but it is far unlike the peace of the beleever, and of the godly, and may be diſcerned by ſundry Marks; but clearly and plainly by theſe two. 1. The peace of the beleever is after great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe and trouble, and much hard war (as we ſay) ere he get unto it, as we ſee in <hi>Paul,</hi> the Jaylor, the Converts in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and theſe ſayings, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and laden. The whole need not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick.</hi> Thus fares it with many, yea in all there muſt be ſomething of this kind, elſe this peace, and Chriſt the Prince of peace, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of this peace, could never be either ſufficiently ſought to, or prized. But the naturall mans peace hath been a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall peace, a token that the <hi>ſtrong man is not yet caſt out:</hi> for he will not be caſt out, without ſome ſenſible unquietneſſe; a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:121267:99"/>that the <hi>New birth</hi> hath not been, for it will not be without ſome pain.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But may not even a naturall man have a touch of conſcience, and afterwards fall into ſecuritie, inſtead of a true peace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He may: and therfore a man ſhould look how his peace hath been purchaſed, how he carried himſelf in the time of his unquietneſſe, if he betook him to wrong means, and by them did ſtrive to ſmother and drive away his unquietneſſe; and not to the right means of the Word, and Prayer, to cure his unquietneſſe, and wounded conſcience: then certainly his peace is not a right peace, he hath but ſmothered the fire which will afterwards break out more violently; he hath but skinned over the wound, which will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards break forth more fearfully.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if a man in the time of his wounding and wakening hath not ſtriven to drive away his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but rather to entertain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, in ſo much as he did conceive it to be a wholſome work of Gods Spirit, and did not tend to infidelitie and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and did labour to cure it by the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:121267:100"/>right means, and did come by it by the Lords means, this is a ſafe and a well grounded peace.</p>
               <p>But moreover, for the further clearing of this point, take in the other difference between the naturall mans peace, and the beleevers peace. The naturall man as he hath alwayes peace, ſo he hath altogether and in all reſpects peace. But the beleever is not ſo, he hath peace with God, but not with the devill; peace in regard of the guiltineſſe of ſin (I mean in regard of the main battell, but wants not skirmiſhes which the wicked have not, for he hath a tender and ſo a combating conſcience) but hath not peace in regard of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſin; for the fleſh warreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit, he hath a continuall Chriſtian warfare. The naturall man wants all this, and hath peace in all theſe reſpects. As peace, ſo joy is the effect of Faith; not a worldly joy ariſing from the abundance of corn, and oyl, or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of that kind; but a ſpirituall joy, a joy that cannot be taken from him: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not in this, but rather rejoyce that your names are written in the book of life;</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:121267:100"/>that he is in favour with God in the light of his countenance. There is a joy of ſanctification ariſing in the heart after the victory of corruption, or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and lively diſcharge of a duty; And there is a joy of juſtification, which is, when we find nothing in our ſelves but corruption and unrighteouſneſſe; and in regard of theſe great failings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe that we have nothing but matter of ſorrow in our ſelves, we reſt, repoſe, rejoyce in the ſufferings of Chriſt, beleeving in him who juſtifies the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through Jeſus Christ.</hi> Thus we glorifie Chriſt. It is the fault of many Chriſtians that they are not as much affected with this joy, as with that of ſanctification; but we are never right, but when we feel ſomething in our ſelves. Surely it is a matter of great repentance, and of godly ſorrow for the offence of God, when we are not right in our ſelves; But for the point of Faith, although we be deſtitute of the joy of ſanctification, yet ſhould we not caſt away the joy of juſtification alſo, but truſt in him <hi>who juſtifieth the ungodly.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>There be joyes that occur in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions of a mans life. There is a ſpirituall joy ariſing from a mans caſe in generall, which he retains oft times when he is deprived of particular ſpirituall joyes; for a man upon his particular fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is not alwaies bewilded in the point of his juſtification, and being in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in generall; <hi>Rejoyce in this, that your names are written in the book of life:</hi> to ſee a man by the means of faith, by the evidences of faith, by the teſtimonie of Gods Spirit bearing witneſſe to his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that he is the ſon of God, that he is in favour with God. This ſpirituall joy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the laſt joy concerning his caſe be the joy of beleevers, and Marks of true Faith. The matter of his joy and ſorrow doth not chiefly and principally ariſe from worldly reſpects, as the naturall mans joy and ſorrow doth; but from the aforeſaid reſpects: when night is come, and a view of the day is taken, the matter of his joy is according as he hath found the Spirit of ſanctification keeping him from tentation and ſin, or ſtrengthening him to the diſcharge of any good duty;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:121267:101"/>Or if there have been failings this way, according as he finds a relying and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for remiſſion and reconciliation, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Moreover, his joy is from his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall caſe and eſtate, if this be clouded, all the contentments in the world will not make him to rejoyce. And again, if this be made ſure, and he ſenſible of that ſureneſſe, he cares the leſſe how it fares with his outward eſtate, he can glory in tribulation, rejoycing in the hope of the glory of God. See then if thou haſt theſe ſpirituall rejoycings, and having them, conclude thou haſt Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If this be a token of true Faith, I have need to fear, for I find not there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings, ſpecially that joy unſpeakable and glorious, I am far from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Yet if this be the axtree of your affections about which they roll, that you fetch your joy and ſorrow from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things eſpecially, it is a good thing, when you conceive any good hope rejoycing, and when otherwiſe ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this is a taking of the matter to heart. 2. The temper of the body it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:121267:102"/>may be melancholick; and for the temper of the minde, it may be yet ſomewhat under the ſpirit of bondage. 3. This of rejoycing is a Mark of a ſtrong, of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, of a victorious Faith not to be alwayes expected (as we ſaid of love) in beginners whoſe faith is weak, and are ever weakning their own faith, through Satans ſubtiltie, the tree of faith in ſome meaſure muſt have ceaſed from ſhogging, before it can bear this fruit of Joy; it may be well rooted not in the time of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſertion, and weightie affliction. 4. The mind of man is narrow, namely, when it comes to ſpirituall things, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain many things at once, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in weak Chriſtians; before one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion be wrought, another vaniſhes, when the impreſſion of humiliation is wrought, and one goes on to get the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of faith, the other vaniſhes; but let the ſenſe of humiliation, and of the wages of ſin, and then the impreſſion and act of faith be both together in the ſoul and mind of a man; this third act of joy will not but follow in ſome meaſure even according to the meaſure of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:121267:102"/>acts. If one ſhall at one time be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his deliverie, and withall ſee and be ſenſible of the greatneſſe of the danger, and puniſhment from the which he is delivered, how can he but rejoyce? Get then theſe two acts, ſenſes, impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of humiliation and faith, and thou ſhalt not fail to rejoyce: but if thou fail in any of theſe, thy joy will abate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. 5. For that joy unſpeakable and glorious, which ſeems to be ſome ſpeciall and peculiar manifeſtation. Theſe be the Lords delicates, reſerved as cordials to be given to his children in great tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtraits, eſpecially if they be ſuffering for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appl.</hi> But if thou be one of thoſe who never had yet any unquietneſſe, and haſt not found the pains of the ſpirituall birth (which is not in all alike, no more then the naturall: ſome come off with more eaſe then others, going preſently to their work, as <hi>Lydia,</hi> and the Jaylor) or if ever thou hadſt any unquietneſſe, yet didſt not betake thee to the right means of a true peace; or haſt thou not a daily Chriſtian warfare with the remnants of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:121267:103"/>ſin; or knoweſt thou not what ſpirituall joy or ſorrow means, but haſt thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken up another way, thou haſt not true faith at all.</p>
               <p>This laſt Mark of faith is from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of it in time of adverſity, it maketh no haſte, betaketh not it ſelf to deſpair, or utter diſcouragement, with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jehoram,</hi> or to any unlawfull ſhifts; but with ſome meaſure of confidence and hope, of quietneſſe and patience, it waits upon God according to that, <hi>It is good for a man both to hope, and quietly to wait for the ſalvation of the Lord:</hi> this is a notable mark and proof of faith.</p>
               <p>The goodneſſe of gold is beſt tryed by the fire and fornace; and even ſo is faith, whether it be upright or no, fained or unfained, by the fiery tryall of affliction; according to that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>That the triall of your faith may be much more precious then of gold that periſheth, though it be tryed with the fire, may be found to praiſe, and honour, and glory.</hi> The ſufficiencie of an Anker is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known in a ſtorme, if it hold out in a great tempeſt; Even ſo is the ſufficiencie of the anker of hope, which flows from
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:121267:103"/>faith, onely beſt known by it's holding out in the time of great adverſitie; for at ſuch a time as this the fleſhly preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hypocrite doth fail him, his hope doth periſh, it is like a Summers brook which dries up when there is moſt need. Will the hypocrite pray alwayes, when it comes to this, his faith proves to be but fantaſie. Whereas the faith of the true beleever though it be in ſuch a caſe much weakned and over-layed, yet it fails not altogether, it may make a great halt, but his faith doth not fail him, it ſtands out, and carries him through the ſtorme of adverſitie: See then if thy faith hath been a ſtanding-out faith, a carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-through faith in the time of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; if it did not make thee make haſte, that is, put thee upon unlawfull ſhifts, but that thou ſtill didſt cleave to God, and the means that he hath appointed, that is, the Word and Prayer? didſt call upon God alwayes, never giving over, and depending upon the Word? Were it <hi>not for thy Word, I had periſhed in my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> and ſo in ſome meaſure of hope and patience didſt wait the Lords will and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:121267:104"/>leiſure? this is a token of true faith, a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith, a faith that maketh not haſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I find much diffidence and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in time of adverſitie, much haſte.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So doth all Gods children: <hi>No ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hath overtaken you, but that which is common to men;</hi> and therfore I ſaid in ſome meaſure of truſt and patience. We ſee even <hi>David</hi> had his haſte; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte all men are lyars.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> had his great impatience; and yet the Spirit of God ſaith, <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job:</hi> the Lord pities his own in their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delities and impatiencies, when they are ſore aſſayed as it were above ſtrength, and above meaſure, and as it were in their raving fits he imputes not theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; he counts not narrowly with them, he ſees this is their infirmitie, and that when the feaver is over, they will come to themſelves: and therefore when they, as it may ſeem both to themſelves and others, have loſt their hold, yet he looſes not his hold, ſo gracious is he. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. <hi>When I ſaid my foot ſlipped, thy mercy, O Lord, upheld me. My heart and my fleſh fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:121267:104"/>hope for ever.</hi> So then even the beſt of the Saints have had in adverſitie their own great haſte, infidelitie, and impatiency, which the Lord did pitie, and paſſe over; So will he thine, if thou haſt done as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, not giving totall place to infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie nor impatiencie: but ever haſt had ſome hope, &amp; truſt, and wreſtling againſt it, like that of <hi>Jonah, I ſaid in my haſte I am cut off from thy preſence, yet I looked again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thy holy Temple: We know not what to do, but our eyes are towards thee.</hi> So then, in a word, although in thy adverſitie thou haſt found great diffidence and impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, yet if thou haſt been ſtriving againſt it, and wreſtling with it; if thou haſt been calling upon God alwayes; if when thou couldſt not pray, ſighing and ſobbing to him: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. If thou haſt been ever look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards his holy Temple through faith, when through infidelitie thou haſt thought thy ſelf caſt out of his preſence; If thy ſoul hath been cleaving to the Word, which upholds us that we periſh not in our afflictions, even when all ſenſe is gone, yea when ſenſe is to the contrary, hoping againſt hope; and hath thy faith
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:121267:105"/>thus wreſtled and brought thee through; then be ſure it is an upright faith, a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith, that hath abided the triall of affliction, a faith that makeeh not haſte.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I told you how you ſhould carrie your ſelf upon your miſſing after triall, to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:121267:105"/>wit, not to give place to deſpair and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter infidelitie, but by conſtant and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer to go to the Anchor and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of faith, who counſels us to come to him, and for our counterfeit wares, promiſes to give us <hi>fine gold tryed in the fire;</hi> who hath promiſed to draw all men unto him, yea who hath made many precious promiſes (whereby we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Divine Nature) concerning all theſe things thou miſſeſt, as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the love of God, the fear of God, &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whereas ye ſay, that ye have not prayed ſo frequently, nor ſo fervently, as ye ſhould, this is a great and ordinary fault, and ſhould be helped, for the Lord doth greatly require fervency, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. in praying, ſeeking with the whole heart, asking, ſeeking, knocking; yea the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves requires it alſo; for theſe things concerne both the Salvation of our own ſoules, <hi>the making of our calling and election ſure,</hi> the good, holy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable will of the Lord our God, and can there be matters of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and importance? Whereas you ſay, that you have thus prayed, and ſo fear that ſeeing the Lord will be ſought for theſe things, and that he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them upon the condition of ſeeking, and of fervent ſeeking, that therfore ye ſhall want them; conſider that the grace of ſeeking he promiſeth it alſo, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>I will powre upon them the ſpirit of grace and ſupplications,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities;</hi> yea for thy comfort, he is found of them who ſeeke him not, much more will he be found of thee who ſeekeſt him, though weakely. But for the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:121267:107"/>laſt, a main point, that you ſay you have prayed often, and fervently, but finds no ſucceſſe; Remember that thou muſt not limit the holy one of Iſrael, how often did he call, and ye did not heare; <hi>By Faith and patience we inherit the promiſes.</hi> But one thing I would inquire, If with praying, thou haſt joyned the uſing of the meanes, for otherwayes, pray thou never ſo much thou ſhalt not obtain; for as in things, that concernes the naturall life, it were but idleneſſe and ſcorne to pray, and in the mean time, not to uſe the meanes, even ſo is it in things concerning the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, the Lord will no more work without meanes, in regard of the one, then in regard of the other; to pray, and to neglect to uſe the meanes, in either of theſe, is to tempt God, and to put him to the working of wonders and miracles: It's true that prayer is the main thing, and brings a bleſſing upon our uſing the meanes, uſe we the meanes never ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, unleſſe by prayer we get the Lord to bleſſe them, he that buildeth, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vaine. But on the other ſide, as our uſing of the meanes cannot ſerve the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:121267:107"/>turn without the Lords bleſſing and working of his Spirit, obtained by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; So the Lord, although he can, yet will he not give, any grace without we uſe the meanes, for ordinarly he works by meanes. Hence is it, <hi>Work out your ſalvation: Plough up the fallow ground of your hearts: Edifie one another in your moſt holy faith:</hi> which is the point in hand.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>If I did not with prayer uſe alſo other meanes, I were greatly to be blamed, but I uſe them according to my power, I frequent the word, Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is good and commendable to uſe the means in generall: but if thou think to ſpeed in that great work, thou muſt not onely do ſo, but ſhouldeſt in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall take heed to this point, to wit, not onely to uſe the means in generall, but to obſerve what be the proper, peculiar, particular moſt fitting and convenient means of that grace that thou doſt want, to beget and entertain it, and carefully to be meditating about them, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, eſpecially ſo feeding your ſelf with food convenient, for every grace
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:121267:108"/>both the own proper &amp; peculiar means, this is to be, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>a wiſe maſter-builder;</hi> As we had need of wiſe maſter builders, ſo we had need our ſelves to be wiſe builders. One that is building an houſe or wall, he will not take any ſtone that is neereſt by him; but he will look what ſtone will fit ſuch a place, and this he takes: Even ſo we ſhould not think it enough in the working of the work of our own ſalvation, we ſhould not think it enough, I ſay, to uſe the means in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; for thus want of wit may make much work, and we may be long enough ere we come to the point: but we ſhould uſe the neereſt, moſt commodious, and moſt convenient means for the begetting of that grace we ſtand in need of. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, feel we want or weakneſſe of the love of God, then ſhould we meditate upon his goodneſſe, kindneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, bountie, patience, pitie, truth, mercie, and the reſt of his amiable properties; his favours, deliverances, benefits. In a word, how good he is in himſelf, and how good he is towards thee: Or doeſt thou find the want of the fear of God, or of reverence
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:121267:108"/>towards him? meditate ſeriouſly of the glory, majeſtie of God, and the reſt of his (awfull) properties, eſpecially if thou haſt found any touch of his juſtice. So find we, that the work of humiliation is but ſmall and weak (this is the ground-work and ſhould be well looked to) you feed upon the threatnings and curſes of the Law, the ſeveritie of them, and their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalitie, how none eſcape them being guiltie of the ſame ſins: <hi>My heart trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid becauſe of thy judgements.</hi> Upon the fierceneſſe of Gods anger againſt ſin, <hi>who knows the power of his wrath;</hi> the infiniteneſſe and ſtrange extent of his juſtice, <hi>His judgements are paſt finding out;</hi> eſpecially haſt thou found a touch of theſe by experience?</p>
               <p>And to come to the point in hand, feareſt thou the want, or feeleſt thou the weakneſſe of Faith? then betake thy ſelf to the particular means of faith, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the precious promiſes of the remiſſion of ſins, the ſure invitations to accept of mercie, the pregnant paſſages of Gods mercifull nature, the Covenant, Oath, &amp;c. this is properly and wiſely to work
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:121267:109"/>out the work of your ſalvation; to work, and to work it out, even firſt of all, to ſearch and try how it fares with thee in regard of this work, whether this work be at all begun in us or not; if the ground work be layd or not, the ground-work of humiliation; and if that be layed, how far is it gone on, whether we have gotten faith, love, &amp;c. and where we find it at a ſtand or ſtay, there, I ſay, we ſhould ſet too carefully, and advance the work, then we ſhould pray moſt earneſtly, and uſe the means moſt diligently; I mean the proper, and particular, and moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient means, as wiſe builders: And as in building, ſo in repairing our ſpirituall building we are to take the ſame courſe, for what we have got before, the ſtamp of them will be ready to ſlip out of our hearts and memories; and we are not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier in building, then Satan is in breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore as we are builders, ſo we muſt be repairers alſo: And ſurely, whoſoever will keep this courſe of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, uſing, feeding, and meditating upon the particular means, not leaning to them, but upon the bleſſing of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:121267:109"/>Lords Spirit procured by prayer, no doubt ſhall find an happie progreſſe in the work of his ſalvation. But above all, we ſhould remember not to lean to the Means, but to the Lords Spirit; for if it be true of the temporall, much more of the ſpirituall; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe the Lord builds the houſe, he that buildeth, buildeth but in vain.</hi> True it is that the Lord pities our fooliſhneſſe; and as he hath a gracious care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the ſalvation of mens bodies, ſo much more hath he a gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over the ſouls of his own, though they be not ſo thriftie and wiſe in their own generation as they ſhould, making them meet with ſuch doctrine, books, conference, that is moſt ſutable to their preſent caſe: but for all this the rule of the uſing of the particular means is much to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Q <hi>How then would you have me go about the particular means of Faith, to get to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the Covenant, &amp;c. and to apply them to my ſelf? For this I would gladly do, but while I am about the doing of it, I dare not apply them to my ſelf, I think they do not belong to me (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though very ſweet in themſelves) and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:121267:110"/>I find not theſe Marks in me which are in Gods children; now the promiſes onely belong to ſuch, I ſee no thing in me but corruption, wants, &amp;c. and miſſe all theſe Marks that you were ſpeaking of, that flow from Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is one of Satans greateſt ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems and wiles, as is to be ſeen by the experience of Gods children; for exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many are born back from laying hold on the promiſes, and other grounds of confidence, upon the very ſame conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, and all by the ſubtiltie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and their own ignorance, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the order and nature of things, and ſo very dangerouſly and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly run firſt to the Marks of Faith, which they will not fail to miſſe, and ſo be diſcouraged; or elſe if any do ſeem to find, do build upon a wrong ground, and ſo are readie to be deceived: Whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they ſhould firſt betake themſelves to the Means, that ſo they may get both a ſound, and a ſtrong faith. Firſt, I ſay, then that this prepoſterous running to the Marks and effects of Faith (ſo inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to many) inſtead of the Means, it comes from not conſidering rightly what
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:121267:110"/>is the very true nature of faith, to wit, that it is a reſting upon the word and promiſe of the faithfull, and powerfull God alone; <hi>Faith is by hearing, and hearing is by the Word of God:</hi> Even as beleeving of a man, is a relying upon his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. This is an eaſie point, but for all that, not duly conſidered by many, which makes them take this wrong courſe; for let ſundrie be poſed, eſpecially thoſe who run ſo haſtily to the Marks of Faith, and ſo diſcourages themſelves to look to the Means; let ſundrie, I ſay, be rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, it ſhall be found, that they make not their faith to reſt upon any thing in God, his truth, &amp;c. but upon ſomething in themſelves; Or to give it the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable expreſſion, they make their faith not to be a reſting upon Gods word, but upon his work; ſhould ſome be asked what did firſt induce them to beleeve, and conſequently what is the ground of their faith: They would anſwer, Becauſe they did find ſuch a change in their life, and ſo forth. Now this is a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous miſtaking, for this ſort of faith that leans only &amp; primarily to ſuch a ground,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:121267:111"/>muſt be a very unſtable faith, mans life being ſo changeable, but alſo if this be the firſt and onely ground of their faith, it muſt be a very falſe and unſound faith, and not partaking of the very nature of faith, which is to reſt on Gods Word, and not on his work; upon the faithfulneſſe and power of God, and not upon any holineſſe in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, Is not this a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good ground to ſtrengthen our faith and aſſurance, to wit, by our good works and ſanctification of life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I grant it is a good way to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then faith in it's own place; but, I ſay, that this aſſurance is not the aſſurance of Faith and beleeving properly, and that it is not that to the which, in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we ſhould betake us, and that it is not the chief prop of our confidence, much leſſe the onely, and that thoſe who make it the onely, have not true faith at all. For the further clearing of this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Divines have well obſerved, that there is in the point of conſidence a twofold aſſurance: one of adherence, the reſting on Gods Word, which is faith.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:121267:111"/>Another which they call the certaintie of evidence, taken from the Marks and effects of Faith: By the one we beleeve; by the other we know that we beleeve. The one is an act of faith, whereby a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves and is juſtified; the other is an act of experience in an old beleever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſees and knows that he beleeves; the one is a direct act of the ſoul, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a reflect act of the ſoul, whereby looking back upon it ſelf, it finds by clear marks and effects, that this Mark of faith is wrought in it, and greatly rejoyces therein. Both theſe aſſurances the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture recommends unto us, the one, while we are commanded to beleeve and reſt upon Gods Word; the other, while we are enjoyned to try whether we be in the faith or not; to make our calling and election ſure by well doing. And further, the Scripture is written to beget both theſe aſſurances in us: <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. And again for the other, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. Now if ye would ask, which of theſe aſſurances hath the preheminence? ſurely the firſt, in theſe reſpects. 1. Becauſe that is it alone that makes up faith (for it is a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:121267:112"/>upon Gods Word) and ſo that which ſaves the ſoul, and glorifies God moſt. 2. It is moſt ſure as leaning to the moſt ſure grounds immutable, ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit, divine teſtimonie, even the promiſe of him who cannot lye; whereas the other being deduced by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, aſſuming concluſion, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, which all being ſubject to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, cannot be ſo infallible. 3. And laſtly, the firſt is the more conſtant aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for it leans upon the truth, mercy, goodneſſe of God, and upon his promiſe; all which admits no change. Whereas the latter aſſurance being taken from ſome effects in us, which are very change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it cannot chooſe but varie alſo; ſo that it is the firſt that holds out in the ſtormes of tentation, deſertions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; and that is our ſureſt anchor in all theſe ſtormes: <hi>Were it not for thy Word I had periſhed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is the firſt aſſurance then that both ſaves the ſoul, and that can make a man moſt conſtantly to have comfort in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or to go on in the ſervice of God; and which is chiefly to be marked, that it is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:121267:112"/>the firſt aſſurance onely that makes faith. Now although the firſt aſſurance in theſe reſpects have the preheminence, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe the other is not to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but greatly to be laboured for, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with the former, it fortifies, it ſtrengthens the anchor of the ſoul, it fils a man with Chriſtian courage, comfort, and cheerfulneſſe, and makes him fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in good works, as is evident, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. and 10. Onely about theſe two aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, we are to beware of theſe two things. 1. That we betake us not to this laſt aſſurance onely, for thus we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, for it cannot be upright, unleſſe we have the other firſt; we may well have a ſhew or form of it, for we may have ſome change of life without faith, but no true change without it; we ſhould not then betake us to it onely, for then we both miſtake the nature of faith, and, as I was ſaying, cannot but deceive our ſelves, which is moſt dangerous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould alſo beware, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us not to this ſecond aſſurance in the firſt roome, for then we miſtake the order of things, and ſhall but diſcourage
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:121267:113"/>our ſelves, and bewilder our ſelves in the point of our firſt aſſurance, and hold our ſelves back from beleeving; for the firſt aſſurance being to beleeve, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to know that we beleeve, how ſhall we know that we beleeve untill it firſt be? and yet this is the courſe that many take, they will firſt know that they beleeve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do labour to beleeve; they will needs have the ſecond aſſurance, before they have the firſt, though it is evident, that they muſt firſt have the firſt, for the ſecond flows from the firſt; yea, and not at the firſt, but from it, being ſomewhat ſtrengthened; they will not have the firſt aſſurance unleſſe they have firſt, or at leaſt with all, the ſecond; whereas they ſhall never have the ſecond, untill firſt of all they have the firſt, and that in ſome good meaſure. But this point of miſtaking the order of things, will be clearer, being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the termes we did propoſe.</p>
               <p>You ſay, that you miſſe many of the Marks of Faith, feel not your heart puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from corruption, find not the love of God, repentance, and ſo forth? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this troubles you, diſcourages you,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:121267:113"/>and weakens you that ye cannot, or dare not apply the Promiſes or Means of faith unto you?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: this comes from miſtaking the order of things, if theſe Marks, ye miſſe, were of things that either go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or accompany faith, you had it may be ſome reaſon for this complaint; but ſeeing they come from theſe things, that follow faith, and are the effects of faith, why ſhould the want of them diſcourage you to beleeve; yea rather they ſhould ſtir you up to beleeve, that ſo you may come by them; for they being the effects of faith, how ſhall ye think to obtain them unleſſe ye firſt beleeve, that is, take and apply the promiſes? I pray you where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence flows victory over corruption, but from faith? Is it not faith that purifies the heart? And wherehence flows the love of God? but even alſo from faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the love of God towards us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> And for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or godly ſorrow, it flows from that love, and is according to the meaſure of that love, as our love is according to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:121267:114"/>meaſure of our faith; ſo outward acts of obedience, faith works by love: ſo then to ſuſpend our faith and beleeving till we get theſe, is the high way never to get faith.</p>
               <p>Further, whence are all theſe things to be gotten, the want whereof diſcourages us to beleeve, are they any other where to be gotten but from Chriſt? or any other way to be gotten from him but by faith? can we get the bloodie iſſue of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions any otherwayes cured but by drawing vertue from Chriſt, and the power of his death? Can we get our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wants otherwayes ſupplyed then out of Chriſt his fulneſſe; or our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all weakneſſe otherwayes helped and ſtrengthened? <hi>I am able to de all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me.</hi> So then, I ſay, we muſt not delay our beleeving, (that is, applying of the Promiſes to our ſelves) till we find theſe things redreſſed; but on the contrary, we muſt beleeve that we may have theſe things helped: thou wilt not beleeve, and apply the Promiſes untill thou findeſt theſe things, but thou ſhalt never find theſe things untill thou
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:121267:114"/>firſt beleeve and apply: we would rather have ſome worthineſſe in our ſelves, then come by faith to Chriſt, but we can have none. Further obſerve, that theſe things do not onely flow from faith, but from faith ſomewhat ſtrengthened. A tree can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth fruit at the firſt, untill the time it be well faſtned, and take ſome rooting: Now theſe things ye ſpeak of, being the fruits of faith, how think ye ſhall they be produced without faith ſomewhat rooted? how ſhall ye expect them as long as ye hold the tree of your faith thus ſhaking and toſſing, &amp; through your own default ſuffer it not to take root?</p>
               <p>So then to conclude, I would adviſe all thoſe who feel the want or weakneſſe of Faith, not to run preſently to the Marks of Faith, I mean thoſe which are taken from the effects of Faith, for this will but encumber their faith, and weaken their applying; this will alſo make them to ſtagger at the promiſe, but I would adviſe them, I ſay, to flie to the Means, and to apply the Promiſes, what ever their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions or wants be; even to do as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:121267:115"/>the father of the faithfull did, he looked not to any inſufficiencie in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to the power and faithfulneſſe of the promiſer; he conſidered not the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his body, &amp;c. and therefore ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered not at the promiſe; but being ſtrong in faith, he gave glory to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed he was able to perform: Even ſo ſhould we, we ſhould not at firſt look to theſe diſcouragements, that preſent themſelves unto us from the deadneſſe and diſeaſes of our own ſouls, for then we ſhall never beleeve, for theſe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe, untill we firſt beleeve; But let us look to the promiſe of a true and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull God, that he is both faith full who hath promiſed, and that he is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he hath promiſed. This was the ground and prop of <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Sarahs</hi> faith, the parents and patterns of the faithfull: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. And theſe ſhould be the props of our faith; But we will have a way of beleeving of our own, and ſuch is our miſchievous infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that we cannot reſt upon God alone, his promiſe, his power, and his truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:121267:115"/>we find ſomething in our ſelves: It is both remarkable and comfortable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. that the Spirit of God there, allows us not onely confidence ſimply, and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but even a ſtrong conſolation, and that from no ground in our ſelves, but onely from God his great truth, in his oath and promiſe.</p>
               <p>Further, let this be added to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, to wit, that thoſe who find their faith weak, not onely betake themſelves to the means of faith before-named, but do dwell upon them, feed upon them, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon them, untill their faith be well ſetled and ſtrengthened, and then the Marks will of their own accord fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for as ſeed doth not grow unleſſe it be firſt harrowed, and lye a while in the earth; and as meat will not ſtrengthen unleſſe it be chewed, and have time to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; even ſo unleſſe we inſiſt and dwell upon the Means of Faith, the Promiſes, Covenant, &amp;c. by frequent and earneſt meditation feeding upon them, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in the midſt of our hearts, they cannot produce any ſetled faith in us; and faith not being produced and ſetled,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:121267:116"/>it cannot produce theſe effects and marks as are requiſite thereunto. I have inſiſted the longer on this, becauſe I find it is one of the greateſt depths of Satan, thus to toſſe in a wind as it were the children of God, whereby many are held back from beleeving; and we our ſelves are in every thing backward, but eſpecially in the point of beleeving. <hi>O ye of little faith, ſlow to beleeve!</hi> The point of faith is a main point, and going out of the way in it, is no leſſe then the hazarding of the ſoul, eſpecially we ſhould take heed that the nature of Faith be not miſtaken, it is a fundamentall errour to erre in the point of Faith.</p>
               <p>In a word, then what ſhal one do when he is in ſuch a caſe, that he can find no Marks or evidences of faith; pray for them, that is true: but for the point of means uſing, there is no other courſe or help to ſtrengthen his faith but this, to ſtrengthen his faith by the means; that ſo faith may bring on theſe evidences. As in the building, ſo in the repairing of Faith.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>I would gladly hear of ſome of thoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:121267:116"/>particular means to beget and ſtrengthen Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt of all, a notable Mean, is due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diligently to conſider of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull nature of the Lord our God, who is our partie with whom we have to deal; as it is moſt ſweetly and richly ſet down to us in Scripture, and all to draw our unbeleeving hearts to reſt upon the ſame. This is a mean and prop of Faith that Gods children have had great recourſe unto; So we ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>Remember O Lord thy tender mercies, for they have been of old. Remember not the ſins of my youth; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy mercy remember me,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</hi> Sweetly ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi> of this, <hi>Mercy and forgiveneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to thee, although we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> So ſweetly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. <hi>Iniquitie hath prevailed againſt us, but thou wilt be mercifull to our tranſgreſſions.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. <hi>If thou mark iniquitie narrowly, who ſhall ſtand? but there is mercy with thee, or forgiveneſſe with thee.</hi> And again, <hi>With the Lord is mercie, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous redemption.</hi> Thus hath Gods children againſt the greatneſſe of their ſins have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:121267:117"/>comforted and upholden their faith by the conſideration of Gods mercie: <hi>The Name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous run unto it, and are ſaved.</hi> Now the name of his mercy is above all his names, as is clear from <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. where the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming his Name to <hi>Moſes,</hi> takes ſo many ſtiles of mercy to him.</p>
               <p>But to the point: the Lord in his word hath been pleaſed, having a regard to our ſlowneſſe to beleive, to ſet down his mercy very richly, largely, pithily, and pregnantly to us, he is ſaid to be plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. to pardon aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, or to multiply pardons, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>To delight in mercy, Micah.</hi> the laſt, <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in theſe that truſt in his mercy; Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>To be rich in mercy, Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>That his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Is he not infinite in his mercy?

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:121267:117"/>pardons iniquities: ſo that now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy ſins be, the greater ſhall be the name of his mercy. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>For thy name ſake pardon my iniquity, for it is great;</hi> the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, though never ſo great; and no wonder, becauſe it is the blood of Chriſt; of God; not with corruptible things, but with the precious blood, and that his own blood, <hi>Acts,</hi> 20. Doth the number of thy ſins trouble thee? he hath multitudes of tender mercies, for the number of thy ſins, he doth multiply par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, if thou haſt multiplied thy ſins, he is rich in mercy, he hath a treaſure of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if thou haſt treaſured up wrath: nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. <hi>Ye have wearied me with your tranſgreſſions, yet come, and I will pardon you, I, even I am he, who for my own names ſake, &amp;c.</hi> He who bids even us to pardon ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie times ſeven times, how oft then will he himſelf pardon?</p>

               <p>A due dwelling upon the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods mercy, thus laid down in Scripture, is a notable prop and mean of faith: for a Chriſtian ſoul may reaſon thus, doth the Lord ſet down his rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo richly and amply in his word, and will he not be as good as his word, will he faile when it comes to the point, and proofe, as men ſometimes uſe to do, who will ſpeak fair, and fail when it comes to the deed and performance? will he not be as good as (his word) he gives himſelf out for? Yes certainly, hath he not ſet out his mercy in this kinde, that our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting, doubting, and withdrawing hearts may be made to reſt upon the ſame; according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. <hi>O how excellent is thy mercie, O Lord, therefore under

               </p>
               <p>A ſecond notable Mean of Faith, is to conſider duly the mercifulnes and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of our high Prieſt our Mediator, eſpecially, his readines to receive ſinners, as we have a mercifull and gracious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo alſo a mercifull Advocate: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. <hi>A mercifull high Prieſt, and faithfull in things pertaining to God, to make reconcilement for the ſins of the people.</hi> This the Scripture makes alſo a notable prop and mean of Faith and confidence, as is clear from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. <hi>Seeing we have ſuch an high Priest, let us come boldly to the throne of grace to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy.</hi> Now for his readineſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive poore ſinners, certainly it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great. It is well obſerved by one, that he never refuſed any who came to him here on earth for the cure of their bodies, although this was not his main errand, yea he prevented ſome, as the man at the Pool; he encouraged others to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when others would have diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them, as the blind man; much leſſe will he refuſe any who come to him for the ſalvation and curing of their ſouls:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:121267:120"/>this being his main errand, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall office, even <hi>to ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> 2 Behold how ſweetly he invites, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and laden: I counſell you to come unto me: He that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out. Ho every one that thirſts; How often would I have gathered you: Behold, I ſtand at the doore and knock: Rev</hi> 3. He beſeeches us to be reconciled by his Embaſſadours: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Now may not a ſenſible ſoul reaſon, He that invites us ſo kindly to come, will he not wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us as kindly when we come? He that beſeeches us to be reconciled unto him, will he not, when we intreat him, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to us? Stands he at the doore and knocks, and will he not open unto ſuch as not onely are willing to let him in, but ſtand at his doore and knock? He that ſo often would have gathered theſe who came not, will he refuſe to any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoul a ſhelter under his wings flying for refuge, and to the horns of ſalvation?</p>

               <p>A third notable Mean of Faith, is to meditate upon, and confider of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold motives, perſwaſions, and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Lord God uſes to draw us to beleeve (O it is not an eaſie matter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve) for the firſt Command is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. this is his Commandment, and he threatens us if we beleeve not, and that moſt fearfully: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and 3.

                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:121267:121"/>Hebr. 4.5. Sometimes the Scripture chids us to beleeve, ſo that as he ſaith of the people of Iſrael, ſo may I ſay of this point, <hi>O Judah, what ſhall I do unto thee? O Ephraim, how ſhall I intreat thee?</hi> Now may not a Chriſtian ſoul gather great grounds to beleeve from theſe inducements, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning thus with himſelf; Doth the Lord command me to beleeve, and ſhal I doubt whether I ought to do it or not? Carry I my ſelf, or would I do ſo in regard of his other Commandments? queſtion I whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall do this or no, and ſhall I draw back from this his moſt acceptable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. Doth the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me ſo to beleeve, ſo to chaſe me, and ſcare my heart from infidelitie, and ſhall I think that it will diſpleaſe him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? No: I can ſee nothing, can be either more dangerous to me, or more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, then not to beleeve, as is to be ſeen <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. and 3. Chapters. 3. Doth he beſeech me to be reconciled (yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny never do regard his entreatie) and will he refuſe them who beſeech him, have beſought him, and by his grace will beſeech him to be reconciled? Is he not
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:121267:121"/>found of thoſe who ſeek him not, and will he not be found of me who ſeek him, though weakly? 4. Doth he bid me come boldly to the throne of his grace, and will he then count it over great boldneſſe in me to do ſo? 5. Bids he me truſt, and that perfectly, and complains he of the ſlowneſſe, of the ſmalneſſe of my faith, and ſhall I be of little faith, ſlow to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve?</p>
               <p>Further, as theſe Motives and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be notable to work us to beleeve, and to drive us from infidelitie; ſo do they clearly teſtifie the Lords great wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to have poore ſinners ſaved, which is alſo a great encouragement to beleeve; for not onely, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner:</hi> but here is our fault, about this point of the Lords wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to ſave us, we will not reſt upon the Lords revealed will as we ought to do, but run to his ſecret will, ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our confidence, for which his reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will affords us ſuch plentiful grounds, and ſo needleſly perplexing our ſelves; for ſecret it is, and ſecret it muſt be. We ſhould hold our ſelves then to the Lords
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:121267:122"/>revealed will, and not pry into his ſecret: this ſeems to be enjoyned by theſe two places eſpecially, to wit, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>v.</hi> laſt: <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord, but things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, and to our children,</hi> even all the words of his Law, that we ſhould do them. As alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. cited out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Say not in thine hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, Who ſhall go up to heaven?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But what ſaith it? The word is nigh unto thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, even the word of faith, which we preach.</hi> So that in the point of our beleeving, or perſwaſion concerning our election and ſalvation, or of the Lords willingneſſe to ſave us, we ſhould not look to the ſecret will of God, thus perplexing our ſelves; but we ſhould betake us to Gods revealed will and Word, and that two wayes, to wit, 1. to <hi>the word of faith, Rom.</hi> 10. or of promiſe, cleaving unto it, for it is the ground and warrant of our faith. 2. To the <hi>word of the Law, Deut.</hi> 29. thus making our calling and election ſure by well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and evidencing to our own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the truth of our faith, it working by love: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>For if ye do theſe things, entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abundantly,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:121267:122"/>Would you then be wiſe to ſalvation, this is the way of it; the way to be ſaved is to beleeve the word of promiſe, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeveth in him, ſhall not be aſhamed;</hi> the way to know if thou beleeve is by ſome effects of faith; <hi>Whoſoever calleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Look if thou be ſuch a one. Both theſe two be ſet down in the former place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. This is alſo clear, that ſuch a courſe as this is to be taken to leave the Lords ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will, and to hold us to his revealed will: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Lords foundation ſtandeth ſure, the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But you will ſay, the Lord knoweth, it is true, who are his, but how ſhall I know this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo my ſelf, if I be one of his?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is his ſeal, <hi>Let him that loveth Chriſt depart from iniquity:</hi> try thy ſelf by this his ſeal; ſo then perplex not thy ſelf with the Lords ſecret will. But, 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt thou <hi>the word of faith which is neer unto thee?</hi> then thy faith hath ſaved thee, be of good comfort. Wouldſt thou again know whether thy faith be true? ſee if <hi>thou calleſt upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> 2. If
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:121267:123"/>thou <hi>depart from iniquity,</hi> for then thou art a ſealed ſoul; but if thou <hi>caſteſt off fear,</hi> and <hi>reſtraineſt prayer,</hi> Job 15. then thou art not right.</p>
               <p>A fourth notable Mean and prop, and ſeed of Faith to obtain it, and to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it, are the plentifull promiſes of mercy and forgiveneſſe of ſins, ſet down unto us in the Word, even as the Apoſtle cals them, <hi>Exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes:</hi> theſe well conſidered, ſhould migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſtrengthen our faith. Have we but the promiſe of an honeſt man for any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, will we not reſt and repoſe upon it, and will it not breed in us, and beget a great meaſure of aſſurance about the thing promiſed? and ſhall we not then be made ſure of this point, of the remiſſion of our ſins, by ſo many promiſes, ſo often renewed, of the faithfull and true God, who is truth it ſelf, and not onely will not, but cannot lye, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: will we reſt upon the Word of a faithfull man, and will not we reſt upon the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of the true God? So that we have both his Word, and his writ for it, he is a God of truth, ſo called by <hi>Moſes,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:121267:123"/>Deut.</hi> 32.4. and 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9. ſaith emphatically, <hi>Know that the Lord thy God is a faithfull God, who keeps Covenant, and mercie:</hi> he ſtyles himſelf, <hi>abundant in truth. Exod.</hi> 34. Great is his faithfulneſſe and love, who keepeth truth for ever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. He is a God of truth; Chriſt is called Truth it ſelf, <hi>The Way, the Truth, and the Life; the faithfull Witneſſe, the holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Truth, the Word of Truth:</hi> And ſhall we doubt of the performance of theſe promiſes? No: let us with <hi>Sarah, judge him faithfull who hath promiſed,</hi> that ſo we may by faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with her obtain the thing promiſed: his truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler. This might be ſufficient for this Mean, but for the further ſtirring up of our backward hearts of unbelief to beleeve, let us conſider theſe two things about the promiſes of forgiveneſſe. 1. Their pregnancie and pithineſſe. 2. Their large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and extent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then the promiſes of mercie and forgiveneſſe of ſin be very pregnant and pithie, the more to perſwade and win up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our untoward hearts of unbelief; for not onely doth the Lord ſimply promiſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:121267:124"/>to pardon our iniquities, but he promiſes to blot them out. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3. The ſame phraſe is uſed to blot out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of ordinances, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto us, that he is not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give us a diſcharge of the debt of our ſins, but becauſe that may ſeem not ſure, for that may haply be loſt, therefore he will deſtroy the bond it ſelf, that it be not brought forth againſt us, even blot it out. Moreover leſt blotting out ſhould not ſeem ſufficiently ſure, for ſome letters may remain, and the whole purpoſe may be taken up by theſe few, he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to waſh away our ſins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>I will cleanſe you from your filthineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>I will make you as the wooll.</hi> Further, leſt even after waſhing, ſome ſtain ſhould remain, in the third roome he is ſaid to cover our tranſgreſſions: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. as alſo 85. O but, will ye ſay, he hath a piercing eye, and will ſee through any covering; therefore the Scripture ſpeaks, of his caſting our ſins behinde his back, that is, out of his ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ſay, what cannot be ſeen, may yet be remembred; what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:121267:124"/>be ſeen by the eye of the body, may be ſeen by the eye of the minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This he promiſes, and it is a part of the Covenant, that he will not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our iniquities; the words are very emphaticall, leſt we ſhould think, that faults once forgotten, may be again cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to memory, therefore he ſaith expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>I will remember their ſins No more.</hi> Once forgot, and ever forgot; <hi>In that day, the iniquitie of Jacob ſhall be ſought for, and ſhall not be found:</hi> a ſweet place. <hi>Micah</hi> the laſt: He will caſt them into the depths of the Sea. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he removed our tranſgreſſiens from us.</hi> We are not to think, that it is for nought that the Spirit of God uſes ſo many, ſo different, and ſo emphaticall phraſes, even becauſe all is little enough to bear up a caſt-down ſoul, and to make it faſten upon the Promiſes; and our hearts being as weak powder, whereinto many ſparks may light, that ſome one of them at leaſt may kindle the fire of faith, at leaſt raiſe the ſmoak thereof: Now the Lord will not quench the ſmoaking flax, but blow upon it by his Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:121267:125"/>
               <p>Q. <hi>Theſe be indeed very pregnant, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great, and precious promiſes: were I ſure that they belong unto me, but, alas, what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant have I for that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is another of Satans depths, and fiery darts, whereby many are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den back, many hearing of the pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the promiſes of forgiveneſſe, and how that there is forgiveneſſe for great and many ſins, conceive ſome hope, but ſtill they fear, that theſe precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes belong not to them, that the offer of reconciliation is not made to them, and ſo ſtick in the application of the promiſe to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now a notable help for this, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the ſecond place the largeneſſe, the indefiniteneſſe, and the extent of the promiſes; for they are conceived in ſuch generall terms, that in effect there is left roome ſufficient for every one to come to ſubſcribe his name, and to ſet to his ſeal that God is true; by ſo doing, to honour God, and ſave his own ſoul: ſo that none is excluded to whom the offer is made, unleſſe they exclude themſelves, and that it be through their own default. The
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:121267:125"/>Promiſes, I ſay, and offer of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſet down in very generall terms, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though mens names be not ſet down, which were needles: <hi>God ſo loved the world, that whoſoever beleeveth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God that takes away the ſins of the world.

Yes (ſaith he) <hi>To you, and to your ſeed, to all that are neer and afar off, and to as many as our God ſhall call,</hi> even by his outward calling: for elſe the words were to no purpoſe. And indeed were it otherwiſe with the Lord, we ſhould make him a mocker, did he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that to any, which did not belong to them: this generalitie of the offer is the very ground and warrant of faith, and therefore ſhould be well looked unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Scripture is clear, that all who are called, ſhall not have the benefit of the promiſes; for directly, <hi>Many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and few are choſen:</hi> and why may not I be of the number of theſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This ſhews indeed that all ſhall not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:121267:126"/>reap the benefit of the promiſes, to wit, through their own default, but not that the promiſe and offer did not belong to them. Further, thou makeſt the wrong uſe of this ſort of doctrine, for it is ſet down in Scripture, not to feed thee in thy infidelitie, but to terrifie thee from the ſame, and to ſtir thee up to beleeve. All this I will clear to you by a familiar ſimilitude. Suppoſe a number of priſoners being impriſoned for ſome great crime, there were a generall Proclamation and offer of liberty made unto them all, who would before ſuch a time make uſe of it, from the free and gracious favour of their Prince; ſuppoſe likewiſe that it could be foreſeen and conjectured, that for all this generall and gracious offer, that yet there would be ſundrie, that would not make uſe of it, ſome of them through azi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſe and ſloth, drinking, or playing, or ſleeping, loſing the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. 2. Others again deſpiſing it, as thinking by their power &amp; abilitie to get free when they pleaſe, or leaning to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer merits or good ſervice done, which they think may well counterpoize any
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:121267:126"/>fault they have committed. And, 3. others (a thing to be took notice of) quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former, through the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and greatneſſe of their fault, ſhould miſdoubt, and misbeleeve the truth of ſo gracious an offer: Suppoſe, I ſay, that all this could be foreſeen, that all theſe ſorts of perſons, upon ſeverall conſiderations, ſhould looſe the opportunitie of the offer, and that therefore for the further weal of the priſoners, and the prevention of all this, with the generall Proclamation an intimation were made to them, that there would be ſuch perſons among them, that ſo they might, being fairly fore-warned, ſlie ſuch impediments; would we not in ſuch a caſe, think him a very fooliſh perſon, who either would not accept of the Proclamation in generall, becauſe his name was not ſet down ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly? or who becauſe of the intimation (made for his further weal and fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and avoiding of ſuch inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) would, through their own default, looſe the opportunitie of the offer, would upon groundleſſe ſuſpitions conclude, that he may be one of that number, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:121267:127"/>ſo keep off and looſe the benefit of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and ſo indeed make himſelf of that number: whereas being fairly fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he ſhould labour to beware of all theſe lets, that may hinder him from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the opportunitie of the offer: Even ſo (to apply this) the Spirit of God in Scripture hath made a gracious gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Proclamation, and promiſe of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, from the priſon and puniſhment of hell, through the Lords tender mercie and free grace in Chriſt Jeſus; and not onely ſo, but fore-ſeeing that for all this gracious and generall offer, many will not reap and take the benefit of the offer, ſome ſlipping and neglecting it, being loath to quit their ſloth and ſinfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; of whom ſpeaks our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Many are called, and few are choſen. Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate: Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Others again lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, ſlight the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is by faith: And, 3. (which thou ſhouldeſt take heed to) others through the great conſcience and ſenſe of their own guiltineſſe are made to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeve
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:121267:127"/>ſo gracious an offer; and what through the power and wiles of the devil, and their own bad heart of unbeleef, greatly prejudice themſelves through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie; of them ſpeaks the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>Take heed lest there be in any of you, an evill heart of unbeleef departing from the living God.</hi> And more cleerly, let us fear that leſt a promiſe being made, &amp;c. The Spirit of God, I ſay, fore-ſeeing all this, with the gracious general offer and proclamation, for our further fore-warning, doth alſo intimate unto us, that notwithſtanding of the gracious and generall offer, yet many through their own default, upon the aforeſaid impediments, ſhall never reap, nor enjoy the benefit of the offer. Now all this is for the advantage and good of thoſe that would beleeve and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the offer, and to drive them from infidelitie, and to ſtir them up to beleeve, and eſchew the lets thereof; and not (as you make wrong uſe of it) to ſuppreſſe your faith: wil you therfore be ſo fooliſh, that either becauſe the proclamation, and offer of mercie, though conceived in generall termes, yet becauſe it hath not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:121267:128"/>thy name expreſly ſet down in it, to think that therefore it belongs not to thee? Or becauſe there is an intimation made, that many through their own default, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the forementioned impediments, ſhall neglect the opportunitie, and looſe the benefit of the offer of grace; For the further fore-warning of thee, and thoſe who would beleeve, to eſchew theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, wilt thou therefore, I ſay, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on groundleſſe ſuſpicions ſay, O what if I be one of theſe, and ſo fly back, and fall into one of the impediments; or ſhouldſt thou not rather ſhun al the impediments, and this of keeping back among the reſt? for, for this end and uſe is it, that the Spirit of God in Scripture hath ſet down theſe ſayings and fore-warnings; <hi>Many are called, and few choſen.</hi> &amp;c. Not to hinder, but to put thee on to beleeve; and indeed in ſo doing, ye make a wrong and quite contrary uſe to that of Scripture, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the offer, the proclamation is made unto all whom God doth call. For the benefit of it, all ſhall not enjoy, through their own default, and they be of two ſorts, to wit, ſuch as ſet either light by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:121267:128"/>the offer and promiſe, who periſh in their preſumption and ſecuritie: Or ſuch as keep back and diſtruſt the promiſe, who periſh through deſperation, and infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now thoſe that ſet lightly, they be of two ſorts; ſome leaning to their own righteouineſſe, and will not quit it, theſe juſtly periſh in their preſumption. 2. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that will not leave their ſins and pleaſures, which is the condition of the offer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. will not take on Chriſts yoke; theſe periſh in their ſecuritie. As for thoſe that keep back, they be ſuch who through Satan and their own hearts are holden back from beleeving; and theſe periſh through deſpair.</p>
               <p>Seeing then thou art not one that doth ſet light by the promiſe and offer, for thou renounceſt thy own righteouſneſſe, and doeſt or wouldſt renounce thy fins and pleaſures, regardeſt not iniquitie in thy heart, deſireſt to fear his Name, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. Then ſee thou be not one that keeps back, yeeld not to Satan, and thy own bad heart of unbelief; remember the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let us fear, leſt a promiſe being left unto us, any of us come ſhort of it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:121267:129"/>through unbelief.</hi> Mark the words, there is a promiſe left unto us (ſo doubt not but the promiſe belongs to thee) onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, thou come not ſhort of it through unblief: and indeed if it were but this, it ſhews that the promiſe belongs to thoſe, who through their own default may come ſhort of it. The benefit of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it is true belongs onely to the elect, and thoſe who are inwardly called; but the promiſe it ſelf, or the offer of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe belongs to all that are outwardly called.</p>
               <p>In a word, thou feareſt that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe belongs not to thee, but the Apoſtle bids thee fear leaſt a promiſe being left unto thee, or belonging to thee, that thou come ſhort of it through unbeleife, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. and therefore let this rather be thy fear, I mean care, to prevent it. But to go more ſuccinctly and cleerly to work with you, you ſay you fear ſuch gratious offers and promiſes, do not belong to you, and how ſhall you know that they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you, they be indefinit ſay you, but not univerſall or generall? 1. I propoſe to you that ſame place, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.29. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:121267:129"/>in direct termes to your doubt, you doubt whether it belongs to you? Yes, <hi>To you, and to your ſeed, and to as many as God ſhall call</hi> And the former place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. does cleer it, that the promiſe is to thoſe who come ſhort of it; the Lord indeed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that which in his fore-knowledge, he ſees will not be accepted, nor made uſe of, and to whom he purpoſes, not to give that grace to make uſe of it, for though he is not obliged, yet the offers neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is reall, and the refuſer juſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. Ought ye not to be content with that ſame meaſure of ſecurity, wherewith all Gods children have bin content, and have repoſed and reſted, even from the begining, and ſtill unto the end of the world, even the word of promiſe; they had no other ground of faith, nor ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for their ſalvation, then this ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite promiſe? One ſaith well, It would have made too large a Bible, if all the names of the elect had been written ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Be content therefore; and be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of thoſe who through faith and patience inherited the promiſes, and do as they did, they ſaluted or embraced
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:121267:130"/>the promiſes, met them mid-way, as it were, and ſo tooke hold of them: ſo ſhould ye not withdraw from, or keepe back from them, but run and meet them as it were, and get unto them, and having gotten them, hold them faſt with both thy armes, and not faintly lay hold on them. 3. I ſay, thou art commanded to apply the generall promiſe to thy ſelf, and therefore thou mayeſt be bold to do it, and of neceſſity it belongs unto thee, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. this is his Commandment, that thou beleive in his Son, not onely that thou beleive the promiſe in general, but alſo that thou beleive in his Sonne, which implyes application of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to thy ſelf, and ſo ſaving faith. Now I reaſon thus, the Commandment, doth ſurely belong unto thee, even all Gods Commandments, thou wilt not, I hope, exempt thy ſelf from any of them, but ſo it is, that the Commandments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee to beleive in his Son, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſe belongs to thee alſo: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou art threatned if thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt not, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. and 3. Chap. 4. The Spirit of God in Scripture, from whom
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:121267:130"/>we ſhould learn to apply, and whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample if we follow, we cannot erre, for he leads into all truth, doth not onely apply the generall and indefinite promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but even ſpeciall promiſes, (ſo to ſpeake) made to the people of Iſrael, to the Corinthians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. and 7. Chap: Yea, even ſingular promiſes made to ſingular perſons, as <hi>Heb.</hi> the laſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Joſuah,</hi> to all the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> now if the Scripture thus teach us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſpeciall and ſingular promiſes made to a peculiar people, to a ſingular perſon, to ourſelves; <hi>All Scripture is written for our uſe and conſelation, that through faith and hope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, I ſay, let it be ſo, that the Promiſes are onely indefinite, in regard of all ſorts of perſons and conditions, yet I am ſure there is one ſort of perſons to whom they are meerly univerſall, to wit, the ſeeking ſenſible ſoul, <hi>Ho, all ye that hunger and thirſt: all ye that are weary and laden;</hi> Every one may have a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation who hath fled for refuge, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O but I fear I hunger and thirſt not, I am not weary, and laden, I have
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:121267:131"/>not fled for a refuge, and ſo want this condition?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This very fear of wanting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhews that there is in thee a deſire, an hunger and thirſt for mercy, as alſo a fear, and conſequently a flying for refuge to the hope that is ſet before thee, a wakening, a ſeeking, a <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> for otherwiſe thou wouldeſt never be affected, nor take to heart, nor fear the want of the condition; wherefore art thou ſo troubled and feared for want of the condition, but becauſe thou art hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and thirſting for that which (thou thinkeſt) is the condition? would make belong to thee, to wit, mercy, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and feareſt, and art troubled for want of the condition, to be deprived of it; So then thou who art troubled, and feareſt to want the condition, required in thoſe to whom mercy is offered, doeſt indeed hunger and thirſt for mercy, doeſt indeed fear, and wouldſt fly unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; for were it not ſo, there would not be all this fear with thee, thou wouldſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be as the reſt of this ſecure world, and as perhaps ſometimes it hath been with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:121267:131"/>thy ſelf, never care how it went with thee in ſo principall a point, whether thou hadſt the condition or not. Now then to ſuch as thou art, who feareſt, who doeſt hunger, and thirſt, the Promiſe is clearly univerſall; it doth belong to all ſuch, none is excepted, as ye heard in the places before cited: <hi>Ho all ye that hunger and thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who is he that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his ſervant? let him truſt in the Name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A fifth notable Mean to beget Faith, or to ſtrengthen it concerning the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſins, it is to conſider the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and precious new Covenant, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord hath covenanted with us, even with us, who be the ſeed of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>I am thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> And, 2. who haſt received the ſeal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Baptiſme; that he will be mercifull to our iniquities, and remember our fins no more: this new Covenant was firſt made with <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.15. and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.7. But is moſt ſweetly, and at length ſet down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. as alſo 42. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. and 16. Chap. 39.21. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. repeated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. Chap. 32.39.40.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:121267:132"/>and 50. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. Now this very thing in generall, that the Lord hath made a Covenant with us, to pardon our ſins, ſhould greatly ſtrengthen our faith concerning the remiſſion of them; for ſo it is, that we have not onely the Lords promiſe for this point, (which certainly in it ſelf is fully ſufficient) but we ſee he hath gone further on to draw us from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie, the which we are ſo prone unto, and to move us to beleeve; he hath made a ſure and ſolemne contract and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, to forgive us our ſins. If we have an honeſt mans promiſe concerning any thing, we will in ſome ſort, yea even in a good meaſure reſt upon it; but if he hath indented with us, and hath by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract bound himſelf unto us, &amp;c. this puts us out of all doubt concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eſpecially where there is no doubt of abilitie and power: How much more then ſhould we confide, when the buſineſſe is between us and the Lord God of truth, <hi>Who keepeth truth for ever? Pſal.</hi> 146.</p>
               <p>Now there be three properties of this new Covenant ſerving greatly to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, to wit, 1. The ſureneſſe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:121267:132"/>and ſteadfaſtneſſe of it. 2. The freeneſſe of it. 3. The compleatneſſe and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it. 1. Then it is a moſt ſure and ſteadfaſt Covenant, unchangeable, unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, everlaſting; what can be more comfortable? this is clear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. where it is called, <hi>The ſure mercies of David.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God; yet hath he made with me an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ordered in all things and ſure:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he rejoyces, and addes, <hi>This is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire.</hi> Pſal. 89.34, 35. <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my mouth. Once have I ſworn by my holineſſe, that I will not lye unto David.</hi> And certainly how can it be but a ſure Covenant, when it hath Chriſt the Son of God for the ſuretie and cautioner? <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. Surely of a better Covenant, how may we be ſure, who beſides ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient a principall, hath ſo reſponſible a caution? And alſo to be the witneſſe of it: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. Now he is <hi>the faithfull witneſſe;</hi> the Mediator of it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Mediator of the new Covenant;</hi> and hath ſealed it with his own death and blood, and in the hiſtory of the Sacrament. Further, to ſhew us the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:121267:133"/>ſureneſſe of it, the Lord cals it the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant,</hi> never to be made null, nor broken on the Lords part. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6. as alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.45.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But you will ſay, although the Lord will not be the firſt, yet when we break with him (as we do continually) will not the Lord then, as he may moſt juſtly, break with us, and ſo alter the Covenant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for it is an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and ſurely were it ſo, it ſhould not be everlaſting, but of very ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. But this is the point, when we break the Covenant on our part by our daily tranſgreſſions, the Lord nevertheleſſe, with whom there is no varying, nor ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of turning, is not like the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent, but keeps ſtill his part of the Covenant, being a God who keeps Covenant and mercy, and gives unto us liberty to renew our part of the Covenant by faith and repentance; ſo that happy is the ſoul that once doth get within this Covenant: this point is evident by that which I have ſpoken of the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:121267:133"/>the renewing of our ſins, he bids us pardon ſeventy times ſeven times, in caſe of repentance, how often then will he pardon, who is infinit in mercy? as far as the heaven is above the earth, ſo much are his waies above your waies: thou ſinneſt daily, it is true, but he hath allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee daily to crave pardon, and ſo to expect forgiveneſſe of ſins, as well as to pray every day, for our daily bread. <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities prevail againſt us, but thou wilt be mercifull to our tranſgreſſions,</hi> ſaith <hi>David. Mercie and forgiveneſſe belongeth to thee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> This point is alſo notably cleared and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>If any man ſin</hi> (ſaith he) even after he hath entred into the Covenant, what ſhall become of him, ſhall he be caſt out of the Covenant again? No: but the ſame who is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the Covenant, and by whoſe means he firſt entred into the Covenant of reconciliation, even he ſhall intercede for him, that he be not caſt out of it again. Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, in ſuch a ſort, not onely to enter us once in the Covenan
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:121267:134"/>with his Father, but which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, when we fail, he is ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for us; He ſits at the right hand of the Father making requeſt for us. And hence is it that this Covenant is ſo ſure, and ſo everlaſting a Covenant. This point is alſo notably and clearly ſet down, and made good, by that ſtyle that <hi>Daniel, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, Ezra</hi> give unto God, <hi>O Lord, who keepeſt Covenant and mercie:</hi> A ſweet ſaying and ſtyle; for both on his own part he keeps Covenant; and then for us when we break and ſin, he hath mercie for us. So in the Scripture we have it more then once, that ſweet combination of <hi>mercy and truth, Pſal.</hi> 57. He will <hi>ſend out his mercie and his truth: Pſal.</hi> 25. all <hi>his wayes are mercy and truth,</hi> &amp;c. His truth is to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; his mercie is to cover our ſins, and to pardon them that they be no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for him to perform his mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: Had he onely truth, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort would be but ſmall, for we make the firſt breach, and fail in the condition; ſo that the Lord may without any breach of his truth and juſtice, break his promiſe with us: but when he joyns mercy with
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:121267:134"/>truth, and is a God that keeps Covenant and mercie, in this ſtands our comfort and happineſſe, and this is it that makes it an everlaſting Covenant. As alſo in that notable <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>My faithfulneſſe and my mercie ſhall be with him.</hi> And again no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him: His mercy endureth for ever.</hi> How often repeated in Scripture, a notable comfort againſt our renewed ſins. But of all moſt notably, clearly, and expreſly is this ſureneſſe and everlaſtingneſſe of the Covenant ſet down in that ſame <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where the Lord profeſſes (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt wonderfull and ſweet) that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſin and the devill ſhould have ſo far prevailed againſt us, as to make us forſake Gods Law, that though he may well viſit our tranſgreſſions with the rod, and our iniquitie with ſtripes, ſo to bring us to repentance; yet <hi>His loving kindneſſe he will not utterly take from us, nor ſuffer his faithfulneſſe to fail:</hi> ſo that he will not break his part of the Covenant for all this. O the wonderfull goodneſſe of God in his Son Chriſt! who although we
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:121267:135"/>change every moment, yet he changeth not; whom he loves, he loves to the end; his gifts and his graces be without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>I hear that upon my repentance I ſhall have acceſſe to this precious Covenant, though after ſeventy times ſeven times, yea infinitely often; for Gods wayes are not like mans wayes, but are above them as far as the heaven is above the earth; which is very comfortable: and alſo that the Lord will take pains with me to bring me to repentance, will viſit me with the rod, &amp;c. O but what if I continue in ſin without repentance, if I be not to be reclaimed, no not by rods, and ſo fall away altogether?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt not get leave to do this, for this is a part and a clauſe of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſure Covenant: <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear into their heart, that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> to wit, altogether, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out returning; this puts on the very top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the ſureneſſe of the Covenant. That place is worth the noting, for in it the Lord undertakes both his own part and ours. This point is alſo notably and clearly ſet down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſetting down the difference between
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:121267:135"/>the old Covenant and the new, he ſaith of the old indeed, they abode not in that Covenant: but for this he ſaith, <hi>I will write my Law in their hearts, and put it in their inward parts.</hi> So <hi>Ezek. I will put my Spirit within them, and cauſe them to walk in my ſtatutes to do them.</hi> So ye may ſee that this is ſtill a moſt ſure and everlaſting Covenant.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But may it not be objected, that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ſureneſſe, everlaſtingnes, and ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe of the Covenant is ready to faſter ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to prove an obſtruction to Christian obedience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It may well make one relent of that ſlaviſh, or at the beſt ſelfiſh, obedience, flowing from fear, and ariſing from ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, and ſelf-reſpects; But as for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable obedience which flows from Faith, and from the love of God, <hi>The love of God conſtraineth me:</hi> ſurely it doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advance and fortifie it; for why as ye ſee, it fortifies faith exceedingly this point of the ſurenes of the Covenant, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingneſſe on Gods part; now faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces this acceptable obedience, faith which worketh by love, the more faith,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:121267:136"/>the more working, and that by love; the more heartie and cheerfull obedience. So whatſoever doctrine ſerves to increaſe faith in us, to breed in us the full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith, is ſo far from rendring us carnally ſecure, and ſo ſluggiſh, as on the contrary it renders us ſpiritually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, it makes us the more working and diligent, it addes ſpirit and life, heart and courage to work: Faith which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love, it both increaſes and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies our obedience; whereas faith, which is the tree, being weak, good works, which are the fruit muſt be few: as the aſſurance of Faith rouſes up the ſoul to go on in a cheerfull and right courſe of obedience with an eye to God; whereas otherwiſe all our obedience is at the beſt felfiſh, if not ſlaviſh. <hi>Do ye faſt unto me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> and even for this reſtraint of fear to ſtand in aw, and not to ſin? This Covenant for all the ſweetneſſe of it, hath ſufficient ground; for as ye hear, although the Lord for the main take not his loving kindneſſe away, yet nevertheleſſe he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits with the rod, and with ſtripes, even with ſad and ſore chaſtiſements; even
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:121267:136"/>where he is favourable, he takes for all that vengeance for tranſgreſſion, even where he corrects in meaſure, he ſuffers not altogether to paſſe unpuniſhed. Hence is that complaint, <hi>Thou haſt wounded me with the wound of an enemie, and chaſtiſed me with the chaſtiſement of a cruell one.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>The Lord hath chaſtiſed me ſore, but hath not delivered me over to death.</hi> There was never ſo much pleaſure in thy ſinning, as thou, who ever thou art, ſhalt find bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thy chaſtiſements for ſin, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the main thing and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be remitted: ſo that thou haſt need to ſtand in awe and not ſin. So that this Covenant, though full of confidence, yet hath ſome place alſo for fear and aw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> When I conſider this ſureneſſe and everlaſtingneſſe of the Covenant, ſurely I muſt think them happie that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and intereſt in it; but I fear that I have none, that it belongs not to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For this, I give no other Anſwer but what I gave to that doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Promiſes; for what is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant but a bundle of Promiſes? As ye heard of the Promiſes, they are <hi>to you, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:121267:137"/>to your ſeed:</hi> Even ſo the Covenant, <hi>I am your God, and the God of your ſeed.</hi> Conſider the other Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>O but I am ſo unworthy guiltie, ſinfull, graceleſſe, I cannot think that it belongs to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For this, conſider the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty the freeneſſe of this Covenant, it is altogether free, from the Lords free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour without any reſpect to any thing in thee, it looks at nothing in thee, no worth in thee can procure it; no unworthineſſe in thee can hinder it: ſo that whatſoever thy condition be, thou needſt not fear to lay hold on it. Now this freeneſſe of this new Covenant, is clear, and may be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by theſe particulars. 1. It is free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not require any prevenient grace or worthineſſe in us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. where this Covenant is ſet down, <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come and buy without money,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Rev.</hi> laſt, <hi>Drink of the water of life freely. Rev.</hi> 3 the poore, the miſerable, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpiritually, are invited and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to come. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ.</hi> 14. <hi>I will love them freely.</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort,</hi> &amp;c. being juſtified freely by his grace; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the Lord ſtands more upon then
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:121267:137"/>the freedom of his grace, that all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the thanks may be to him. 2. It is free not onely becauſe it doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>require or preſuppoſe any worthineſſe in us, but it doth alſo take off former guilt; we ſhould remember, that it is made for the behoof of ſinners, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> We are ſaved by beleeving in him who juſtifies the ungodly. But, I ſay, this Covenant takes off even exceeding great by-paſt guiltineſſe, as is clear from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. where the Covenant is mentioned, <hi>I will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 1. although they were never ſo great, though as red as ſcarlet: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. although they were never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: <hi>Ye have wearied me with your tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet I am he,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is a worthy ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by all means to be received by thee, that Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave ſinners:</hi> yea and the chief of ſinners; and not onely <hi>Paul,</hi> but him to be a pattern to others, who afterwards ſhould beleeve in him. Now all theſe tends to the further manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the riches of his grace and mercy. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. <hi>For his Names ſake be pardons iniquitie:</hi> now the greater, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:121267:138"/>the more thy ſins have been, the greater ſhall be the name of his mercy, and the freeneſſe of his grace. 3. This Covenant ſtands not onely with by-paſt guiltineſſe, but (which ſhews the freeneſſe thereof) with much preſent ſinfulneſſe and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe, if felt and mourned for. This is clear from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>When I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thy blood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet even then I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſſe: I ſware unto thee, and entred into Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine. Then I waſhed thee with water, yea I throughly waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away the blood from thee,</hi> &amp;c. So we ſee, how that ſinfulneſſe of diſpoſition doth not let the Lord to enter into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, and ſhould not diſcourage us to lay hold on the Covenant. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. where there is mention of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant more then once: <hi>Not for your ſakes, O houſe of Iſrael, be it known unto you: Be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and confounded for your own wayes, but for my Names ſake.</hi> And he tels them, that they were a ſtiffe-necked and a rebellious people, rather worſe, then better then other people; And ſurely there are not
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:121267:138"/>more rough pieces of work, and greater ſinners then many on whom the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows grace; that ſo the glory of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and power of his grace, even divine power may be better known: So then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy works, nor thy by-paſt guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor thy preſent ſinfulneſſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ought to hinder thee from lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on this Covenant, ſeeing it is in all theſe reſpects a free Covenant; but, as ye ſhall hear, it is the onely way to get all theſe redreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O but this Covenant promiſes, that I ſhall have a new heart; be cleanſed from my filthineſſe, &amp;c. theſe things I find not: hence is it that juſtly I doubt, that the Promiſes of remiſſion of ſins belongs not to me, ſeeing the other Promiſes of ſanctification be not accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou wilt not beleeve that they may be accompliſhed, think you, that all the conditions of the Covenant ſhall be performed to you, or can become yours, untill by faith you lay hold on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, untill by faith you ſubſcribe the Covenant, and ſet to thy ſeale, that God is true, thou haſt not entred into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:121267:139"/>nor cannot be ſaid to have done it, untill thou ſubſcribe it by beleeving, and ſo no wonder thou haſt not reaped the benefits of the Covenant; go to then, and enter thy ſelf in the Covenant, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, ſeale it by beleeving, and then ſhalt thou find the vertue and benefit of theſe promiſes of Sanctification, and go not to ſuſpend thy beleeving, becauſe thou findeſt not the accompliſhment of the promiſes: for ye heard, it is faith that brings forth holineſſe, and Sanctification. But the next and laſt property of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is able to give you ſatisfaction, and it is the abſoluteneſſe and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Covenant, I call it a compleat Covenant, becauſe the Lord hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in it to fullfill, both his own part, and our part; what could be wiſhed for more? ſo that whatſoever it requireth of thee, it promiſes to give the ſame unto thee, as faith, repentance, the grace of prayer, the fear of God, victory over cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and finally ſtrength to walke outwardly, in the waies of the Lords obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Hence I call it an abſolute Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe it not onely hath conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:121267:139"/>on all promiſes, promiſing eternall life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, ſuch and ſuch things to thoſe who beleeve, repent, love, fear God, &amp;c. But it hath in it, abſolute promiſes, (which properly be the new Covenant) promiſing even theſe very conditions, to wit, faith, repentance, &amp;c. What can be more ſweet and comfortable, certainly, there is not any point in Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, more comfortable, or more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable by us, then is this of the abſolute promiſes, and of the compleatneſſe of the new Covenant, and how that the Lord hath undertaken both for his own part, and our part herein; for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of this, many poore Chriſtian ſoules are holden back mightily, and are diſcouraged, for they thinke with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many things, and amongſt the reſt remiſſion of ſins, to be promiſed to thoſe that fear and love God, that beleive and repent, that ſeek by prayer, &amp;c. But alas, I want theſe conditions, and ſo have no intereſt in the promiſes. Now would ſuch perſons conſider, that theſe very conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be promiſed to be wrought in them, and that ſo the Lord hath undertaken to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:121267:140"/>do them for us, both his part, and ours, and hath undertaken and promiſed that we ſhall beleeve, repent, fear, love, ſeek by prayer, ſo that we have no more to do, but by faith and patience to cleave unto it, and to wait for the inheriting of thoſe precious promiſes, when it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to accompliſh them unto us, and in us: what can be more comfortable then this it gives reſt to the ſoul; and indeed were it not thus, what ſhould be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and comfort of the doctrine, and tenour of the Goſpel? for it is as hard and impoſſible, as far without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of our power, as is the tenour of the Law, it is as hard and impoſſible for us to beleeve and repent, (this being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and tenour of the Goſpel) as it is to fullfill the whole Law. But herein ſtands the comfort of the Goſpel above the Law, of the new Covenant above the old, that the Law promiſes upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but does not promiſe nor give ſtrength to perform the condition: Whereas the Goſpel and new Covenant, not onely promiſes upon condition, but alſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and gives ſtrength to perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:121267:140"/>it ſelf, to wit, faith, repentance, the grace and gift of prayer, the fear, the love of God, and theſe be the abſolute promiſes. Hence it is that it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. to be <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> to wit, becauſe here in this new Covenant the Lord gives vnto us abſolute promiſes, not onely upon condition, but even the very condition it ſelf, promiſes not onely to do his own part, but our part alſo; theſe be indeed better promiſes. And hence is it, that in the ſame place he ſaith, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not in that Covenant, to wit, in the old Covenant, and why? Becauſe they undertook fairly for themſelves, <hi>We will do all that the Lord commands us.</hi> But what ſaith the Lord, knowing their weakneſſe, and the rather of their undertaking, O that there were ſuch a heart within them! but for this Covenant, it ſhall not be ſo, with them, for I will do their part alſo, they ſhall abide in it, <hi>They ſhall not depart from me, I will write my Law in their hearts.</hi> And hence is it, that Chriſt is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a better Covenant; this ſo main a point, ſhould be more taught, and more conſidered, for it is the very upholding of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:121267:141"/>a Chriſtian ſoul, a notable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the courſe of Sanctification, for now thou haſt no more to do, but to look carefully, what grace thou wanteſt, and then to look for the promiſe of ſuch a grace; and having found the promiſe, thou ſhouldeſt labour with all humility to beleive it, and then with that meaſure of faith that God beſtows, thou ſhouldeſt preſent thy daily Petitions to God, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for that grace to be given unto thee, out of the fulneſſe of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, by the operation of the holy Spirit, patiently, confidently, fervently, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, proſecuting thy Suite, from day to day, untill the Lord ſatisfie thee, which he will not fail to do, if thou thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; onely thou ſhouldeſt be carefull to do theſe two things, to wit, to beleive, and fervently to ſeeke, for theſe two the Lord requires, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 18.10. to wit, in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged deſire. And, 2. by faith to receive it, as I conceive it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them:</hi> this is ſubjoyned to all theſe precious promiſes, of the new Covenant,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:121267:141"/>in that Chapter. So that it is not enough for us to have the Promiſes, but we muſt uſe the Means of earneſt Prayer and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Ye receive not becauſe ye ask not,</hi> at leaſt not ſo fervently and uprightly as ye ſhould: <hi>The prayer of the faithfull availeth much,</hi> if it be fervent; If thou beleeve, all things are poſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O but I fail in theſe two, I cannot beleeve nor pray as I ſhould; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I fear to come ſhort of theſe precious promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Indeed we fail all too much in the fervencie of our ſeeking, and it is hard to beleeve miracles and wonders; for ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the performance of theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whether it be the ſubduing of our ſtrong faſt hanging on corruptions, or the ſupplying of our wants, eſpecially to thoſe who are ſenſible either of the one, or of the other, and have continued long under ſuch a ſenſe: O when ſhall I get ſuch a corruption ſubdued, when ſuch a grace wrought? not conſidering that <hi>God is able to do execeding abundantly above all that we are able to ask or think:</hi> Able to make all grace to abound towards us for his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:121267:142"/>power. And then for his willingneſſe, more willing to beſtow, then we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſeek; gives liberally to all, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids none: counſels thee to come to him, and get fine gold, &amp;c. Theſe be the two notable props of thy Faith, in this point. But for the point in hand, thou canſt not come to beleeve, nor to ſeek as thou ſhouldeſt, and therefore thou feareſt thou ſhalt come ſhort of the Promiſes; Even theſe two, amongſt the reſt, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, to wit, the grace of faith, and the grace of prayer. Prayer is clearly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12. A ſweet place alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. Faith is promiſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. <hi>I will draw all men unto me:</hi> this drawing is cauſing them to beleeve, for he is the Author and finiſher of our faith. <hi>No man can come unto me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Father draw him</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26. <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my ſalvation.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Thou ſhalt call me, My Father, and ſhalt not depart from me.</hi> Repentance is promiſed, the godly ſorrow, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.43. turning with the whole heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. the fear of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:121267:142"/>
               <p>Further, in this Covenant is promiſed what thy heart could wiſh for ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for ſtrengthening of thy Faith, and making thy calling and election ſure. Thou findeſt and feeleſt an hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart, the ſinfulneſſe of thy nature, and this holds thee back from beleeving; here a new heart is promiſed. Feeleſt thou ſtrong corruptions? <hi>I will cleanſe you from all your filthineſſe,</hi> &amp;c. Thou feeleſt and feareſt thy want of outward obedience; it is promiſed alſo, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo we ſee it to be an abſolute and compleat Covenant, the Lord in it undertaking both for his own part and ours; and in it promiſing, not onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, but even the very condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, which is very comfortable.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this point of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Go to then, O thou of little faith, what hinders thee to beleeve the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thy ſins, ſeeing the Lord God hath not onely promiſed it to thee, but even ſolemnly covenanted with thee, and then hath made with thee for it ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo everlaſting, ſo free, ſo compleat and abſolute a Covenant, able to anſwer all thy doubts.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:121267:143"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> O but I am ſo unworthy that I dare not beleeve it belongs to me ſo graceleſſe and full of wants; ſo full of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt guiltineſſe, of preſent ſinfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In all theſe reſpects it is a free Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, diſpenſing with all theſe three as ye heard, the Lord undertakes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to redreſſe all theſe things in thee, ſo thou will by faith ſubſcribe and enter into this new Covenant with him: he knows thou art ſuch a one, or elſe why ſhould he make ſuch promiſes to thee, to pardon, to give a new heart, to cleanſe thee, &amp;c. and yet this ſtayes him not to enter into Covenant with thee.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>O but I want the condition that ſhould be on my part, I cannot beleeve, I cannot repent, how ſhall I then lay hold on the Covenant for remiſſion of ſins, ſeeing it is at what time a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repents, the Lord will do away his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Even theſe conditions are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us, as ye heard; It is an abſolute Covenant, hath abſolute promiſes, a compleat Covenant, wherein the Lord hath undertaken both for his own part, and for ours.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:121267:143"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But I break the Covenant daily, and how ſhall I think but that the Lord will alſo break with me?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is an everlaſting Covenant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou break, the Lord will not break, for he is a God that keeps Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and mercy; If thou break, he may well chaſtiſe thee with the rods of men, but his everlaſting mercy, his loving kindneſſe will he never take from thee: yea even in this point of chaſtiſement, he will give thee leave to prevent him by holding an Aſſize upon thy ſelf, if thou wilt judge thy ſelf, thou ſhalt not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea although thou fail even in this, yet he will correct thee in meaſure, both for degree, laying no more upon thee, then thou art able to bear: and alſo for time, his anger indures but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; O how gracious a God, how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Covenant! And whereas thou ſayeſt, thou breakeſt, thou ſhalt not make a finall, nor a full breach: <hi>He that is born of God, ſinneth not. I will put my fear into your heart, that ye ſhall not depart from me.</hi> Thus far for the comfort and ſtrengthening of faith in this new Covenant; onely a
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:121267:144"/>word for caution, and it is this. If ever we think to finde the benefit of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we ſhould embrace it fully, that is to ſay, not onely to be ſaved, but to be ſanctified by it; we muſt make uſe of the Promiſes, not onely of Juſtification, but of Sanctification alſo, or otherwiſe we ſhall miſſe both; we ſhould take heed that we fail not in this, for then we ſhall divide what the Lord hath conjoyned, we ſhall prove our ſelves to want both thankfulneſſe, and ſincerity: we may ſee how the Lord puts theſe together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.4. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Stays he here? No, but if he hath caſed thee of one burthen, thou muſt take on another; hath he eaſed thee of a great
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:121267:144"/>burthen, that would have preſſed thee to hell, thou muſt take up for him a light one; and is it not moſt reaſonable, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him in doing and ſuffering? take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you my yoke, <hi>My yoke is eaſie, and my burthen is light;</hi> O that we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this when we are about the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of corruptions, the diſcharging of duties! This alſo is cleer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. where the Covenant is mentioned, <hi>Let the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man forſake his wayes,</hi> &amp;c. ſee the place.</p>
               <p>The laſt Mean of ſtrengthening our faith, which I ſhall propoſe unto you, is a very notable one, to wit, to confider the oath of God, concerning this purpoſe: this oath is ſet down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89 <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſſe unto David:</hi> But moſt pregnantly, and in moſt pathetick terms, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>men ſwear by a greater, and an oath to them is the end of all ſtrife.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, ſo ſhould it be in this point betwixt God and you, this oath ſhould put an end to all the ſtrife of our infidelity, which ſo much oppoſes the truth of God. We are very backward to beleive, even like an incredulous body, that will give no truſt, he will not beleeve
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:121267:145"/>his neighbour, untill he ſwear to him, and then he reſts ſatisfied. Even ſo deal we with the Lord, we are ſo backward to beleeve, ſo ſlow to beleeve, as our Saviour ſpeaks, that we will not beleive the Lords bare promiſe, and yet the Lord of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſſe, rather pitying, then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing our infidelity; he condeſcends thus far, for willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of Promiſe, the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his counſell, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge unto the hope that is ſet before us. There be here many ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and confirming words, and greatly comfortable; and therfore by any means, ſeeing the Lord hath gone ſo far on with us, let us not diſtruſt him, let us not ſtrive any more by infidelity againſt him; but let this oath be the end of all ſtrife betwixt our infidelity and the Lord: Let us with <hi>Abraham</hi> give glory to God by beleeving, and take to our ſelves the comfort of this abundant and ſtrong conſolation; yea, let us be afraid to do
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:121267:145"/>otherwayes, for, we may ſee, how fain the Lord would have us to beleive, and how acceptable a thing it is to him to beleeve, he delights in thoſe that truſt in his mercy; As alſo how prone we are to infidelity, &amp; how hardly we are brought to beleeve; So likewiſe, we may cleerly ſee, how hainous a ſin infidelity is, for it doth not only make the Lord a lyar, who cannot lye, but it is alſo to make him a Covenant-breaker, who is indeed the faithfull one. Therefore ſeriouſly weigh, and effectually improve the Means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; ſo ſhall God be greatly glorified, and thine own Soul eternally ſaved.</p>
